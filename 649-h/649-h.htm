7</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1846, the Percy Society issued
to its members a volume entitled <i>Ancient Poems</i>,
<i>Ballads</i>, <i>and Songs of the Peasantry of England</i>,
edited by Mr. James Henry Dixon.&nbsp; The sources drawn upon by
Mr. Dixon are intimated in the following extract from his
preface:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>He who, in travelling through the rural districts
of England, has made the road-side inn his resting-place, who has
visited the lowly dwellings of the villagers and yeomanry, and
been present at their feasts and festivals, must have observed
that there are certain old poems, ballads, and songs, which are
favourites with the masses, and have been said and sung from
generation to generation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This traditional, and, for the most part, unprinted
literature,&mdash;cherished in remote villages, resisting
everywhere the invasion of modern namby-pamby verse and jaunty
melody, and possessing, in an historical point of view, especial
value as a faithful record of the feeling, usages, and modes of
life of the rural population,&mdash;had been almost wholly passed
over amongst the antiquarian revivals which constitute one of the
distinguishing features of the present age.&nbsp; While attention
was successfully drawn to other forms of our early poetry, this
peasant minstrelsy was scarcely touched, and might be considered
unexplored ground.&nbsp; There was great difficulty in collecting
materials which lay scattered so widely, and which could be
procured in their genuine simplicity only from the people amongst
whom they originated, and with whom they are as &lsquo;familiar
as household words.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was even still more difficult
to find an editor who combined genial literary taste with the
local knowledge of character, customs, and dialect, indispensable
to the collation of such reliques; and thus, although their
national interest was universally recognised, they were silently
permitted to fall into comparative oblivion.&nbsp; To supply this
manifest <i>desideratum</i>, Mr. Dixon compiled his volume for
the Percy Society; and its pages, embracing only a selection from
the rich stores he had gathered, abundantly exemplified that
gentleman&rsquo;s remarkable qualifications for the labour he had
undertaken.&nbsp; After stating in his preface that contributions
from various quarters had accumulated so largely on his hands as
to compel him to <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>omit many pieces he was desirous of preserving, he thus
describes generally the contents of the work:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>In what we have retained will be found every
variety,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;From grave to gay,
from lively to severe,&rsquo;</p>
<p>from the moral poem and the religious dialogue,&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The scrolls that
teach us to live and to die,&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>to the legendary, the historical, or the domestic ballad; from
the strains that enliven the harvest-home and festival, to the
love-ditties which the country lass warbles, or the comic song
with which the rustic sets the village hostel in a roar.&nbsp; In
our collection are several pieces exceedingly scarce, and
hitherto to be met with only in broadsides and chap-books of the
utmost rarity; in addition to which we have given several others
never before in print, and obtained by the editor and his
friends, either from the oral recitation of the peasantry, or
from manuscripts in the possession of private individuals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The novelty of the matter, and the copious resources disclosed
by the editor, acquired for the volume a popularity extending far
beyond the limited circle to which it was addressed; and although
the edition was necessarily restricted to the members of the
Percy Society, the book was quoted not only by English writers,
but by some of the most distinguished arch&aelig;ologists on the
continent.</p>
<p>It had always been my intention to form a collection of local
songs, illustrative of popular festivals, customs, manners, and
dialects.&nbsp; As the merit of having anticipated, and, in a
great measure, accomplished this project belongs exclusively to
Mr. Dixon, so to that gentleman I have now the pleasure of
tendering my acknowledgments for the means of enriching the
Annotated Edition of the English Poets with a volume which, in
some respects, is the most curious and interesting of the
series.</p>
<p>Subsequently to the publication of his collection by the Percy
Society, Mr. Dixon had amassed additional materials of great
value; and, conscious that the work admitted of considerable
improvement, both in the way of omission and augmentation, he
resolved upon the preparation of a new edition.&nbsp; His reasons
for rejecting certain portions of the former volume are stated in
the following extract from a communication with which he has
obliged me, and which may be considered as his own introduction
to the ensuing pages.</p>
<blockquote><p>The editor had passed his earliest years in a
romantic mountain-district in the North of England, where old
customs and manners, and old songs and ballads still
linger.&nbsp; Under the influence of these associations, he
imbibed a passionate love for peasant rhymes; having little
notion at that time that the simple minstrelsy which afforded <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>him so much
delight could yield hardly less pleasure to those who cultivated
more artificial modes of poetry, and who knew little of the life
of the peasantry.&nbsp; His collection was not issued without
diffidence; but the result dissipated all apprehension as to the
estimate in which these essentially popular productions are
held.&nbsp; The reception of the book, indeed, far exceeded its
merits; for he is bound in candour to say that it was neither so
complete nor so judiciously selected as it might have been.&nbsp;
Like almost all books issued by societies, it was got up in
haste, and hurried through the press.&nbsp; It contained some
things which were out of place in such a work, but which were
inserted upon solicitations that could not have been very easily
refused; and even where the matter was unexceptionable, it
sometimes happened that it was printed from comparatively modern
broadsides, for want of time to consult earlier editions.&nbsp;
In the interval which has since elapsed, all these defects and
short-comings have been remedied.&nbsp; Several pieces, which had
no legitimate claims to the places they occupied, have been
removed; others have been collated with more ancient copies than
the editor had had access to previously; and the whole work has
been considerably enlarged.&nbsp; In its present form it is
strictly what its title-page implies&mdash;a collection of poems,
ballads, and songs preserved by tradition, and in actual
circulation, amongst the peasantry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><i>Bex</i>, <i>Canton de Vaud</i>,<br />
<i>Switzerland</i>.</p>
<p>The present volume differs in many important particulars from
the former, of the deficiencies of which Mr. Dixon makes so frank
an avowal.&nbsp; It has not only undergone a careful revision,
but has received additions to an extent which renders it almost a
new work.&nbsp; Many of there accessions are taken from extremely
rare originals, and others are here printed for the first time,
including amongst the latter the ballad of <i>Earl Brand</i>, a
traditional lyric of great antiquity, long familiar to the dales
of the North of England; and the <i>Death of Queen Jane</i>, a
relic of more than ordinary intesest.&nbsp; Nearly forty songs,
noted down from recitation, or gathered from sources not
generally accessible, have been added to the former collection,
illustrative, for the most part, of historical events, country
pastimes, and local customs.&nbsp; Not the least suggestive
feature in this department are the political songs it contains,
which have long outlived the occasions that gave them birth, and
which still retain their popularity, although their allusions are
no longer understood.&nbsp; Amongst this class of songs may be
specially indicated <i>Jack and Tom</i>, <i>Joan&rsquo;s Ale was
New</i>, <i>George Ridler&rsquo;s Oven</i>, and <i>The Carrion
Crow</i>.&nbsp; The songs of a strictly rural character, having
reference to the occupations and intercourse of the people,
possess an interest which cannot be adequately measured by their
poetical pretensions.&nbsp; The very defects of art with which
they are chargeable, constitute their highest claim to
consideration as authentic specimens of country <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>lore.&nbsp;
The songs in praise of the dairy, or the plough; or in
celebration of the harvest-home, or the churn-supper; or
descriptive of the pleasures of the milk-maid, or the courtship
in the farm-house; or those that give us glimpses of the ways of
life of the waggoner, the poacher, the horse-dealer, and the boon
companion of the road-side hostelrie, are no less curious for
their idiomatic and primitive forms of expression, than for their
pictures of rustic modes and manners.&nbsp; Of special interest,
too, are the songs which relate to festival and customs; such as
the <i>Sword Dancer&rsquo;s Song and Interlude</i>, the
<i>Swearing-in Song</i>, <i>or Rhyme</i>, <i>at Highgate</i>, the
<i>Cornish Midsummer Bonfire Song</i>, and the <i>Fairlop Fair
Song</i>.</p>
<p>In the arrangement of so multifarious an anthology, gathered
from nearly all parts of the kingdom, the observance of
chronological order, for obvious reasons, has not been attempted;
but pieces which possess any kind of affinity to each other have
been kept together as nearly as other considerations would
permit.</p>
<p>The value of this volume consists in the genuineness of its
contents, and the healthiness of its tone.&nbsp; While
fashionable life was masquerading in imaginary Arcadias, and
deluging theatres and concert rooms with shams, the English
peasant remained true to the realities of his own experience, and
produced and sang songs which faithfully reflected the actual
life around him.&nbsp; Whatever these songs describe is true to
that life.&nbsp; There are no fictitious raptures in them.&nbsp;
Love here never dresses its emotions in artificial images, nor
disguises itself in the mask of a Strephon or a Daphne.&nbsp; It
is in this particular aspect that the poetry of the country
possesses a permanent and moral interest.</p>

<h3>THE PLAIN-DEALING MAN.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> oldest copy of the <i>Plain
Dealing Man</i> with which we have been able to meet is in black
letter, printed by T. Vere at the sign &lsquo;Of the Angel
without Newgate.&rsquo;&nbsp; Vere was living in 1609.]</p>
<p class="poetry">A <span class="smcap">crotchet</span> comes
into my mind<br />
Concerning a proverb of old,<br />
Plain dealing&rsquo;s a jewel most rare,<br />
And more precious than silver or gold:<br />
And therefore with patience give ear,<br />
And listen to what here is penned,<br />
These verses were written on purpose<br />
The honest man&rsquo;s cause to defend.<br />
For this I will make it appear,<br />
And prove by experience I can,<br />
&rsquo;Tis the excellen&rsquo;st thing in the world<br />
To be a plain-dealing man.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet some are so impudent grown,<br />
They&rsquo;ll domineer, vapour, and swagger,<br />
And say that the plain-dealing man<br />
Was born to die a beggar:<br />
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>But men
that are honestly given<br />
Do such evil actions detest,<br />
And every one that is well-minded<br />
Will say that plain dealing is best.<br />
For this I will make it appear,<br />
And prove by experience I can,<br />
&rsquo;Tis the excellen&rsquo;st thing in the world<br />
To be a plain-dealing man.</p>
<p class="poetry">For my part I am a poor man,<br />
And sometimes scarce muster a shilling,<br />
Yet to live upright in the world,<br />
Heaven knows I am wondrous willing.<br />
Although that my clothes be threadbare,<br />
And my calling be simple and poor,<br />
Yet will I endeavour myself<br />
To keep off the wolf from the door.<br />
For this I will make it appear,<br />
And prove by experience I can,<br />
&rsquo;Tis the excellen&rsquo;st thing in the world<br />
To be a plain-dealing man.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now, to be brief in discourse,<br />
In plain terms I&rsquo;ll tell you my mind;<br />
My qualities you shall all know,<br />
And to what my humour&rsquo;s inclined:<br />
I hate all dissembling base knaves<br />
And pickthanks whoever they be,<br />
And for painted-faced drabs, and such like,<br />
They shall never get penny of me.<br />
For this I will make it appear,<br />
And prove by experience I can,<br />
&rsquo;Tis the excellen&rsquo;st thing in the world<br />
To be a plain-dealing man.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor can I abide any tongues<br />
That will prattle and prate against reason,<br />
About that which doth not concern them;<br />
Which thing is no better than treason.<br />
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Wherefore
I&rsquo;d wish all that do hear me<br />
Not to meddle with matters of state,<br />
Lest they be in question called for it,<br />
And repent them when it is too late.<br />
For this I will make it appear,<br />
And prove by experience I can,<br />
&rsquo;Tis the excellen&rsquo;st thing in the world<br />
To be a plain-dealing man.</p>
<p class="poetry">O fie upon spiteful neighbours,<br />
Whose malicious humours are bent,<br />
And do practise and strive every day<br />
To wrong the poor innocent.<br />
By means of such persons as they,<br />
There hath many a good mother&rsquo;s son<br />
Been utterly brought to decay,<br />
Their wives and their children undone.<br />
For this I will make it appear,<br />
And prove by experience I can,<br />
&rsquo;Tis the excellen&rsquo;st thing in the world<br />
To be a plain-dealing man.</p>
<p class="poetry">O fie upon forsworn knaves,<br />
That do no conscience make<br />
To swear and forswear themselves<br />
At every third word they do speak:<br />
So they may get profit and gain,<br />
They care not what lies they do tell;<br />
Such cursed dissemblers as they<br />
Are worse than the devils of hell.<br />
For this I will make it appear,<br />
And prove by experience I can,<br />
&rsquo;Tis the excellen&rsquo;st thing in the world<br />
To be a plain-dealing man.</p>
<p class="poetry">O fie upon greedy bribe takers,<br />
&rsquo;Tis pity they ever drew breath,<br />
For they, like to base caterpillars,<br />
Devour up the fruits of the earth.<br />
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>They&rsquo;re apt to take money with both hands,<br />
On one side and also the other,<br />
And care not what men they undo,<br />
Though it be their own father or brother.<br />
Therefore I will make it appear,<br />
And show very good reasons I can,<br />
&rsquo;Tis the excellen&rsquo;st thing in the world<br />
To be a plain-dealing man.</p>
<p class="poetry">O fie upon cheaters and thieves,<br />
That liveth by fraud and deceit;<br />
The gallows do for such blades groan,<br />
And the hangmen do for their clothes wait.<br />
Though poverty be a disgrace,<br />
And want is a pitiful grief,<br />
&rsquo;Tis better to go like a beggar<br />
Than to ride in a cart like a thief.<br />
For this I will make it appear,<br />
And prove by experience I can,<br />
&rsquo;Tis the excellen&rsquo;st thing in the world<br />
To be a plain-dealing man.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now let all honest men judge,<br />
If such men as I have here named<br />
For their wicked and impudent dealings,<br />
Deserveth not much to be blamed.<br />
And now here, before I conclude,<br />
One item to the world I will give,<br />
Which may direct some the right way,<br />
And teach them the better to live.<br />
For now I have made it appear,<br />
And many men witness it can,<br />
&rsquo;Tis the excellen&rsquo;st thing in the world<br />
To be a plain-dealing man.</p>
<p class="poetry">1.&nbsp; I&rsquo; th&rsquo; first place
I&rsquo;d wish you beware<br />
What company you come in,<br />
For those that are wicked themselves<br />
May quickly tempt others to sin.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>2.&nbsp; If youths be induc&egrave;d with wealth,<br />
And have plenty of silver and gold,<br />
I&rsquo;d wish them keep something in store,<br />
To comfort them when they are old.</p>
<p class="poetry">3.&nbsp; I have known many young prodigals,<br

Which have wasted their money so fast,<br />
That they have been driven in want,<br />
And were forc&egrave;d to beg at the last.</p>
<p class="poetry">4.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d wish all men bear a good
conscience,<br />
And in all their actions be just;<br />
For he&rsquo;s a false varlet indeed<br />
That will not be true to his trust.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now to conclude my new song,<br />
And draw to a perfect conclusion,<br />
I have told you what is in my mind,<br />
And what is my [firm] resolution.<br />
For this I have made it appear,<br />
And prove by experience I can,<br />
&rsquo;Tis the excellen&rsquo;st thing in the world<br />
To be a plain-dealing man.</p>
<h3>THE VANITIES OF LIFE.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> following verses were copied
by John Clare, the Northamptonshire peasant, from a MS. on the
fly-leaves of an old book in the possession of a poor man,
entitled <i>The World&rsquo;s best Wealth</i>; <i>a Collection of
choice Councils in Verse and Prose</i>.&nbsp; <i>Printed for A.
Bettesworth</i>, <i>at the Red Lion in Paternoster-row</i>,
1720.&nbsp; They were written in a &lsquo;crabbed, quaint hand,
and difficult to decipher.&rsquo;&nbsp; Clare remitted the poem
(along with the original MS.) to Montgomery, the author of <i>The
World before the Flood</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c., by whom it was
published in the <i>Sheffield Iris</i>.&nbsp; Montgomery&rsquo;s
criticism is as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Long as the poem appears to
the eye, it will abundantly repay the trouble of perusal, being
full of condensed and admirable thought, as well as diversified
with exuberant imagery, and embellished with peculiar felicity of
language: the moral points in the closing couplets of the stanzas
are often powerfully enforced.&rsquo;&nbsp; Most readers will
agree in the justice of these remarks.&nbsp; <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>The poem was,
probably, as Clare supposes, written about the commencement of
the 18th century; and the unknown author appears to have been
deeply imbued with the spirit of the popular devotional writers
of the preceding century, as Herbert, Quarles, &amp;c., but seems
to have modelled his smoother and more elegant versification
after that of the poetic school of his own times.]</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;Vanity of
vanities, all is vanity.&rsquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Solomon</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">What</span> are
life&rsquo;s joys and gains?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What pleasures crowd its ways,<br />
That man should take such pains<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To seek them all his days?<br />
Sift this untoward strife<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On which thy mind is bent,<br />
See if this chaff of life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is worth the trouble spent.</p>
<p class="poetry">Is pride thy heart&rsquo;s desire?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is power thy climbing aim?<br />
Is love thy folly&rsquo;s fire?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is wealth thy restless game?<br />
Pride, power, love, wealth and all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Time&rsquo;s touchstone shall destroy,<br />
And, like base coin, prove all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vain substitutes for joy.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dost think that pride exalts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thyself in other&rsquo;s eyes,<br />
And hides thy folly&rsquo;s faults,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which reason will despise?<br />
Dost strut, and turn, and stride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like walking weathercocks?<br />
The shadow by thy side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Becomes thy ape, and mocks.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dost think that power&rsquo;s disguise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can make thee mighty seem?<br />
It may in folly&rsquo;s eyes,<br />

<h3>THE LIFE AND AGE OF MAN.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">From</span> one of Thackeray&rsquo;s
Catalogues, preserved in the British Museum, it appears that
<i>The Life and Age of Man</i> was one of the productions printed
by him at the &lsquo;Angel in Duck Lane, London.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Thackeray&rsquo;s imprint is found attached to broadsides
published between 1672 and 1688, and he probably commenced
printing soon after the accession of Charles II.&nbsp; The
present reprint, the correctness of which is very questionable,
is taken from a modern broadside, the editor not having been
fortunate enough to meet with any earlier edition.&nbsp; This old
poem is said to have been a great favourite with the father of
Robert Burns.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> prime of years,
when I was young,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I took delight in youthful ways,<br />
Not knowing then what did belong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto the pleasures of those days.<br />
At seven years old I was a child,<br />
And subject then to be beguiled.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>At two times seven I went to learn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What discipline is taught at school:<br />
When good from ill I could discern,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought myself no more a fool:<br />
My parents were contriving than,<br />
How I might live when I were man.</p>
<p class="poetry">At three times seven I wax&egrave;d wild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When manhood led me to be bold;<br />
I thought myself no more a child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My own conceit it so me told:<br />
Then did I venture far and near,<br />
To buy delight at price full dear.</p>
<p class="poetry">At four times seven I take a wife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And leave off all my wanton ways,<br />
Thinking thereby perhaps to thrive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And save myself from sad disgrace.<br />
So farewell my companions all,<br />
For other business doth me call.</p>
<p class="poetry">At five times seven I must hard strive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What I could gain by mighty skill;<br />
But still against the stream I drive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bowl up stones against the hill;<br />
The more I laboured might and main,<br />
The more I strove against the stream.</p>
<p class="poetry">At six times seven all covetise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Began to harbour in my breast;<br />
My mind still then contriving was<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How I might gain this worldly wealth;<br />
To purchase lands and live on them,<br />
So make my children mighty men.</p>
<p class="poetry">At seven times seven all worldly thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Began to harbour in my brain;<br />
Then did I drink a heavy draught<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of water of experience plain;<br />
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>There none
so ready was as I,<br />
To purchase bargains, sell, or buy.</p>
<p class="poetry">At eight times seven I wax&egrave;d old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And took myself unto my rest,<br />
Neighbours then sought my counsel bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I was held in great request;<br />
But age did so abate my strength,<br />
That I was forced to yield at length.</p>
<p class="poetry">At nine times seven take my leave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of former vain delights must I;<br />
It then full sorely did me grieve&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I fetch&egrave;d many a heavy sigh;<br />
To rise up early, and sit up late,<br />
My former life, I loathe and hate.</p>
<p class="poetry">At ten times seven my glass is run,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I poor silly man must die;<br />
I look&egrave;d up, and saw the sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had overcome the crystal sky.<br />
So now I must this world forsake,<br />
Another man my place must take.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now you may see, as in a glass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole estate of mortal men;<br />
How they from seven to seven do pass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Until they are threescore and ten;<br />
And when their glass is fully run,<br />
They must leave off as they begun.</p>
<h3>THE YOUNG MAN&rsquo;S WISH.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">From</span> an old copy, without
printer&rsquo;s name; probably one from the Aldermary Church-yard
press.&nbsp; Poems in triplets were very popular during the reign
of Charles I., and are frequently to be met with during the
Interregnum, and the reign of Charles II.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">If</span> I could but
attain my wish,<br />
I&rsquo;d have each day one wholesome dish,<br />
Of plain meat, or fowl, or fish.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>A glass of port, with good old beer,<br />
In winter time a fire burnt clear,<br />
Tobacco, pipes, an easy chair.</p>
<p class="poetry">In some clean town a snug retreat,<br />
A little garden &lsquo;fore my gate,<br />
With thousand pounds a year estate.</p>
<p class="poetry">After my house expense was clear,<br />
Whatever I could have to spare,<br />
The neighbouring poor should freely share.</p>
<p class="poetry">To keep content and peace through life,<br />
I&rsquo;d have a prudent cleanly wife,<br />
Stranger to noise, and eke to strife.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then I, when blest with such estate,<br />
With such a house, and such a mate,<br />
Would envy not the worldly great.</p>
<p class="poetry">Let them for noisy honours try,<br />
Let them seek worldly praise, while I<br />
Unnotic&egrave;d would live and die.</p>
<p class="poetry">But since dame Fortune&rsquo;s not thought
fit<br />
To place me in affluence, yet<br />
I&rsquo;ll be content with what I get.</p>
<p class="poetry">He&rsquo;s happiest far whose humble mind,<br
/>
Is unto Providence resigned,<br />
And thinketh fortune always kind.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then I will strive to bound my wish,<br />
And take, instead of fowl and fish,<br />
Whate&rsquo;er is thrown into my dish.</p>
<p class="poetry">Instead of wealth and fortune great,<br />
Garden and house and loving mate,<br />
I&rsquo;ll rest content in servile state.</p>
<p class="poetry">I&rsquo;ll from each folly strive to fly,<br />
Each virtue to attain I&rsquo;ll try,<br />
And live as I would wish to die.</p>

<h3>A DIALOGUE BETWIXT AN EXCISEMAN AND DEATH.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Transcribed</span> from a copy in the

epitaph which we remember to have seen in a village church-yard
at the foot of the Wrekin, in Shropshire, commencing
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;The King of Heaven a warrant got,<br />

A blunt exciseman, which abhorred the day,<br />
Was rambling forth to seek himself a booty<br />
&rsquo;Mongst merchant&rsquo;s goods which had not paid the
duty;<br />
But walking all alone, Death chanced to meet him,<br />

I thought that gold (which answereth all things) could<br />
Have stood my friend at any time to bail me!<br />
But grief grows great, and now my trust doth fail me.<br />
Oh! that my conscience were but clear within,<br />
Which now is rack&egrave;d with my former sin;<br />
With horror I behold my secret stealing,<br />
My bribes, oppression, and my graceless dealing;<br />
My office-sins, which I had clean forgotten,<br />
Will gnaw my soul when all my bones are rotten:<br />
I must confess it, very grief doth force me,<br />
Dead or alive, both God and man doth curse me.<br />
<i>Let all Excisemen</i> hereby warning take,<br />
To shun their practice for their conscience sake.</p>

My carnal life makes me afraid to die.<br />
My sins, alas! are many, gross and foul,<br />
Oh, righteous Lord! have mercy on my soul!<br />
And though I do deserve thy righteous frown,<br />
Yet pardon, Lord, and pour a blessing down.<br />
[Then with a dying sigh her heart did break,<br />
And did the pleasures of this world forsake.]</p>

A lump of clay&mdash;so vile a creature&rsquo;s man.<br />
Then happy those whom Christ has made his care,<br />
Who die in the Lord, and ever bless&egrave;d are.<br />
The grave&rsquo;s the market-place where all men meet,<br />
Both rich and poor, as well as small and great.<br />
If life were merchandise that gold could buy,<br />
The rich would live, the poor alone would die.</p>

<p>For the many aggravating sins too much practised in our
present mournful times: as Pride, Drunkenness, Blasphemous
Swearing, together with the Profanation of the Sabbath;
concluding with the sin of wantonness and disobedience; that upon
our hearty sorrow and forsaking the same the Lord may save us for

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">You</span> sober-minded
christians now draw near,<br />
Labour to learn these pious lessons here;<br />
For by the same you will be taught to know<br />
What is the cause of all our grief and woe.</p>
<p class="poetry">We have a God who sits enthroned above;<br />
He sends us many tokens of his love:<br />
Yet we, like disobedient children, still<br />
Deny to yield submission to His will.</p>
<p class="poetry">The just command which He upon us lays,<br />
We must confess we have ten thousand ways<br />
Transgressed; for see how men their sins pursue,<br />
As if they did not fear what God could do.</p>

Of that good God who gave him life and breath,<br />
And who can strike him with the darts of death!</p>
<p class="poetry">The very little children which we meet,<br />
Amongst the sports and pastimes in the street,<br />
We very often hear them curse and swear,<br />
Before they&rsquo;ve learned a word of any prayer.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis much to be lamented, for I fear<br

The same they learn from what they daily hear;<br />
Be careful then, and don&rsquo;t instruct them so,<br />
For fear you prove their dismal overthrow.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>Both young and old, that dreadful sin forbear;<br />
The tongue of man was never made to swear,<br />
But to adore and praise the bless&egrave;d name,<br />
By whom alone our dear salvation came.</p>
<p class="poetry">Pride is another reigning sin likewise;<br />
Let us behold in what a strange disguise<br />
Young damsels do appear, both rich and poor;<br />
The like was ne&rsquo;er in any age before.</p>
<p class="poetry">What artificial ornaments they wear,<br />
Black patches, paint, and locks of powdered hair;<br />
Likewise in lofty hoops they are arrayed,<br />
As if they would correct what God had made.</p>

charms,<br />
They must lie down in death&rsquo;s cold frozen arms!<br />
Oh think on this, and raise your thoughts above<br />
The sin of pride, which you so dearly love.</p>
<p class="poetry">Likewise, the wilful sinners that transgress<br
/>
The righteous laws of God by drunkenness,<br />
They do abuse the creatures which were sent<br />
Purely for man&rsquo;s refreshing nourishment.</p>
<p class="poetry">Many diseases doth that sin attend,<br />
But what is worst of all, the fatal end:<br />
Let not the pleasures of a quaffing bowl<br />
Destroy and stupify thy active soul.</p>

Many young wanton gallants seldom mind<br />
The church of God, but scornfully deride<br />
That sacred word by which they must be tried.</p>
<p class="poetry">A tavern, or an alehouse, they adore,<br />
And will not come within the church before<br />
They&rsquo;re brought to lodge under a silent tomb,<br />
And then who knows how dismal is their doom!</p>
<p class="poetry">Though for awhile, perhaps, they flourish
here,<br />
And seem to scorn the very thoughts of fear,<br />

They can&rsquo;t outbrave the bitter stroke of death!</p>
<p class="poetry">Consider this, young gallants, whilst you
may,<br />
Swift-wing&egrave;d time and tide for none will stay;<br />
And therefore let it be your christian care,<br />
To serve the Lord, and for your death prepare.</p>
<p class="poetry">There is another crying sin likewise:<br />
Behold young gallants cast their wanton eyes<br />
On painted harlots, which they often meet<br />
At every creek and corner of the street,</p>
<p class="poetry">By whom they are like dismal captives led<br />
To their destruction; grace and fear is fled,<br />
Till at the length they find themselves betrayed,<br />
And for that sin most sad examples made.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then, then, perhaps, in bitter tears
they&rsquo;ll cry,<br />
With wringing hands, against their company,<br />
Which did betray them to that dismal state!<br />
Consider this before it is too late.</p>
<p class="poetry">Likewise, sons and daughters, far and near,<br
/>
Honour your loving friends, and parents dear;<br />
Let not your disobedience grieve them so,<br />
Nor cause their ag&egrave;d eyes with tears to flow.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

To dear indulgent parents, when they see<br />
Their stubborn children wilfully run on<br />
Against the wholesome laws of God and man!</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh! let these things a deep impression make<br

Upon your hearts, with speed your sins forsake;<br />
For, true it is, the Lord will never bless<br />
Those children that do wilfully transgress.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, to conclude, both young and old I pray,<br

Reform your sinful lives this very day,<br />

<h3>SMOKING SPIRITUALIZED.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> following old poem was long
ascribed, on apparently sufficient grounds, to the Rev. Ralph
Erskine, or, as he designated himself, &lsquo;Ralph Erskine,
V.D.M.&rsquo;&nbsp; The peasantry throughout the north of England
always call it &lsquo;Erskine&rsquo;s song,&rsquo; and not only
is his name given as the author in numerous chap-books, but in
his own volume of <i>Gospel Sonnets</i>, from an early copy of
which our version is transcribed.&nbsp; The discovery however, by
Mr. Collier, of the First Part in a MS. temp. Jac. I., with the
initials G. W. affixed to it, has disposed of Erskine&rsquo;s
claim to the honour of the entire authorship.&nbsp; G. W. is
supposed to be George Withers; but this is purely conjectural;
and it is not at all improbable that G. W. really stands for W.
G., as it was a common practice amongst anonymous writers to
reverse their initials.&nbsp; The history, then, of the poem,
seems to be this: that the First Part, as it is now printed,
originally constituted the whole production, being complete in
itself; that the Second Part was afterwards added by the Rev.
Ralph Erskine; and that both parts came subsequently to be
ascribed to him, as his was the only name published in connexion
with the song.&nbsp; The Rev. Ralph Erskine was born at Monilaws,
Northumberland, on the 15th March, 1685.&nbsp; He was one of the
thirty-three children of Ralph Erskine of Shieldfield, a family
of repute descended from the ancient house of Marr.&nbsp; He was
educated at the college in Edinburgh, obtained his licence to
preach in June, 1709, and was ordained, on an unanimous
invitation, over the church at Dunfermline <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>in August,
1711.&nbsp; He was twice married: in 1714 to Margaret Dewar,
daughter of the Laird of Lassodie, by whom he had five sons and
five daughters, all of whom died in the prime of life; and in
1732 to Margaret, daughter of Mr. Simson of Edinburgh, by whom he
had four sons, one of whom, with his wife, survived him.&nbsp; He
died in November, 1752.&nbsp; Erskine was the author of a great
number of <i>Sermons</i>; <i>a Paraphrase on the Canticles</i>;
<i>Scripture Songs</i>; <i>a Treatise on Mental Images</i>; and
<i>Gospel Sonnets</i>.</p>
<p><i>Smoking Spiritualized</i> is, at the present day, a
standard publication with modern ballad-printers, but their
copies are exceedingly corrupt.&nbsp; Many versions and
paraphrases of the song exist.&nbsp; Several are referred to in
<i>Notes and Queries</i>, and, amongst them, a broadside of the
date of 1670, and another dated 1672 (both printed before Erskine
was born), presenting different readings of the First Part, or
original poem.&nbsp; In both these the burthen, or refrain,
differs from that of our copy by the employment of the expression
&lsquo;<i>drink</i> tobacco,&rsquo; instead of
&lsquo;<i>smoke</i> tobacco.&rsquo;&nbsp; The former was the
ancient term for drawing in the smoke, swallowing it, and
emitting it through the nostrils.&nbsp; A correspondent of
<i>Notes and Queries</i> says, that the natives of India to this
day use the phrase &lsquo;hooka peue,&rsquo; to <i>drink</i> the
hooka.]</p>

MASONIC HYMN.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> is a very ancient production,
though given from a modern copy; it has always been popular
amongst the poor &lsquo;brethren of the mystic tie.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The late Henry O&rsquo;Brien, A.B., quotes the seventh verse in
his essay <i>On the Round Towers of Ireland</i>.&nbsp; He
generally had a common copy of the hymn in his pocket, and on
meeting with any of his antiquarian friends who were not Masons,
was in the habit of thrusting it into their hands, and telling
them that if they understood the mystic allusions it contained,
they would be in possession of a key which would unlock the
pyramids of Egypt!&nbsp; The tune to the hymn is peculiar to it,
and is of a plaintive and solemn character.]</p>

He sent him unto thee to make thy heart glad;<br />
Thy seed shall increase like stars in the sky,<br />
And thy soul into heaven like Gabriel shall fly.</p>
<p class="poetry">O, never, O, never will I hear an orphan
cry,<br />
Nor yet a gentle virgin until the day I die;<br />
You wandering Jews that travel the wide world round,<br />
May knock at the door where truth is to be found.</p>
<p class="poetry">Often against the Turks and Infidels we
fight,<br />
To let the wandering world know we&rsquo;re in the right,<br />
For in heaven there&rsquo;s a lodge, and St. Peter keeps the
door,<br />
And none can enter in but those that are pure.</p>
<p class="poetry">St. Peter he opened, and so we entered in,<br
/>
Into the holy seat secure, which is all free from sin;<br />
St. Peter he opened, and so we entered there,<br />
And the glory of the temple no man can compare.</p>

BETWEEN THE HUSBANDMAN AND SERVINGMAN.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">The tune is, <i>I am the Duke of
Norfolk</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> ancient dialogue, though in a
somewhat altered form (see the ensuing poem), has long been used
at country merry-makings.&nbsp; It is transcribed from a
black-letter copy in the third volume of the Roxburgh collection,
apparently one of the imprints of Peter Brooksby, which would
make the composition at least as old as the close of the
fifteenth century.&nbsp; There are several dialogues of a similar
character.]</p>
<p style="text-align: center">ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="poetry">The servingman the plowman would invite<br />
To leave his calling and to take delight;<br />
But he to that by no means will agree,<br />
Lest he thereby should come to beggary.<br />
He makes it plain appear a country life<br />
Doth far excel: and so they end the strife.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">My</span> noble friends
give ear, if mirth you love to hear,<br />
I&rsquo;ll tell you as fast as I can,<br />
A story very true, then mark what doth ensue,<br />
Concerning of a husbandman.<br />
A servingman did meet a husbandman in the street,<br />
And thus unto him began:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">I pray you tell to me of what calling you
be,<br />
Or if you be a servingman?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HUSBANDMAN.</p>

clear,<br />
And the truth you shall understand:<br />
I do no one disdain, but this I tell you plain,<br />
I am an honest husbandman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">If a husbandman you be, then come along with
me,<br />
I&rsquo;ll help you as soon as I can<br />
Unto a gallant place, where in a little space,<br />
You shall be a servingman.</p>

<p class="poetry">Sir, for your diligence I give you many
thanks,<br />
These things I receive at your hand;<br />
I pray you to me show, whereby that I might know,<br />
What pleasures hath a servingman?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">A servingman hath pleasure, which passeth time
and measure,<br />
When the hawk on his fist doth stand;<br />
His hood, and his verrils brave, and other things, we have,<br />
Which yield joy to a servingman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HUSBANDMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">My pleasure&rsquo;s more than that to see my
oxen fat,<br />
And to prosper well under my hand;<br />
And therefore I do mean, with my horse, and with my team,<br />
To keep myself a husbandman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">O &rsquo;tis a gallant thing in the prime time
of the spring,<br />
To hear the huntsman now and than<br />
His bugle for to blow, and the hounds run all a row:<br />
This is pleasure for a servingman!<br />
To hear the beagle cry, and to see the falcon fly,<br />
And the hare trip over the plain,<br />
And the huntsmen and the hound make hill and dale rebound:<br />
This is pleasure for a servingman!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HUSBANDMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis pleasure, too, you know, to see the
corn to grow,<br />
And to grow so well on the land;<br />
The plowing and the sowing, the reaping and the mowing,<br />
Yield pleasure to the husbandman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">At our table you may eat all sorts of dainty
meat,<br />
Pig, cony, goose, capon, and swan;<br />
And with lords and ladies fine, you may drink beer, ale, and
wine!<br />
This is pleasure for a servingman.</p>

Which contents the honest husbandman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">At the court you may have your garments fine
and brave,<br />
And cloak with gold lace laid upon,<br />
A shirt as white as milk, and wrought with finest silk:<br />
That&rsquo;s pleasure for a servingman!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HUSBANDMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">Such proud and costly gear is not for us to
wear;<br />
Amongst the briers and brambles many a one,<br />
A good strong russet coat, and at your need a groat,<br />
Will suffice the husbandman.<br />
A proverb here I tell, which likes my humour well,<br />
And remember it well I can,<br />
If a courtier be too bold, he&rsquo;ll want when he is old.<br />
Then farewell the servingman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">It needs must be confest that your calling is
the best,<br />
No longer discourse with you I can;<br />
But henceforth I will pray, by night and by day,<br />
Heaven bless the honest husbandman.</p>
<h3>A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE HUSBANDMAN AND THE SERVINGMAN.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> traditional version of the
preceding ancient dialogue has long been popular at country
festivals.&nbsp; At a harvest-home feast at Selborne, in
Hampshire, in 1836, we heard it recited by two countrymen, who
gave it with considerable humour, and dramatic effect.&nbsp; It
was delivered in a sort of chant, or recitative.&nbsp; Davies
Gilbert published a very similar copy in his <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span><i>Ancient
Christmas Carols</i>.&nbsp; In the modern printed editions, which
are almost identical with ours, the term &lsquo;servantman&rsquo;
has been substituted for the more ancient designation.]</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Well</span> met, my brother
friend, all at this highway end,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So simple all alone, as you can,<br />
I pray you tell to me, what may your calling be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you not a servingman?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HUSBANDMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">No, no, my brother dear, what makes you to
inquire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of any such a thing at my hand?<br />
Indeed I shall not feign, but I will tell you plain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a downright husbandman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">If a husbandman you be, then go along with
me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And quickly you shall see out of hand,<br />
How in a little space I will help you to a place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where you may be a servingman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HUSBANDMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">Kind sir! I &lsquo;turn you thanks for your
intelligence,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These things I receive at your hand;<br />
But something pray now show, that first I may plainly know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The pleasures of a servingman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">Why a servingman has pleasure beyond all sort
of measure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With his hawk on his fist, as he does stand;<br />
For the game that he does kill, and the meat that does him
fill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are pleasures for the servingman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HUSBANDMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">And my pleasure&rsquo;s more than that, to see
my oxen fat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a good stock of hay by them stand;<br />
My plowing and my sowing, my reaping and my mowing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are pleasures for the husbandman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">Why it is a gallant thing to ride out with a
king,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a lord, duke, or any such man;<br />
To hear the horns to blow, and see the hounds all in a row,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That is pleasure for the servingman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HUSBANDMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">But my pleasure&rsquo;s more I know, to see my
corn to grow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So thriving all over my land;<br />
And, therefore, I do mean, with my plowing with my team,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep myself a husbandman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">Why the diet that we eat is the choicest of all
meat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such as pig, goose, capon, and swan;<br />
Our pastry is so fine, we drink sugar in our wine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That is living for the servingman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HUSBANDMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">Talk not of goose nor capon, give me good beef
or bacon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And good bread and cheese, now at hand;<br />
With pudding, brawn, and souse, all in a farmer&rsquo;s house,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That is living for the husbandman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">Why the clothing that we wear is delicate and
rare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With our coat, lace, buckles, and band;<br />
Our shirts are white as milk, and our stockings they are silk,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That is clothing for a servingman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HUSBANDMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">But I value not a hair your delicate fine
wear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such as gold is laced upon;<br />
Give me a good grey coat, and in my purse a groat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That is clothing for the husbandman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">Kind sir! it would be bad if none could be
had<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those tables for to wait upon;<br />
There is no lord, duke, nor squire, nor member for the shire,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can do without a servingman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>HUSBANDMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">But, Jack! it would be worse if there was none
of us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To follow the plowing of the land;<br />
There is neither king, lord, nor squire, nor member for the
shire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can do without the husbandman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SERVINGMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">Kind sir! I must confess&rsquo;t, and I humbly
protest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give you the uppermost hand;<br />
Although your labour&rsquo;s painful, and mine it is so very
gainful,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I were a husbandman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HUSBANDMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">So come now, let us all, both great as well as
small,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray for the grain of our land;<br />
And let us, whatsoever, do all our best endeavour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For to maintain the good husbandman.</p>

<h3>THE THREE KNIGHTS.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">(TRADITIONAL.)</span></p>
<p>[<i>The Three Knights</i> was first printed by the late Davies
Gilbert, F.R.S., in the appendix to his work on <i>Christmas
Carols</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Gilbert thought that some verses were
wanting after the eighth stanza; but we entertain a different
opinion.&nbsp; A conjectural emendation made in the ninth verse,
viz., the substitution of <i>far</i> for <i>for</i>, seems to
render the ballad perfect.&nbsp; The ballad is still popular
amongst the peasantry in the West of England.&nbsp; The tune is
given by Gilbert.&nbsp; The refrain, in the second and fourth
lines, printed with the first verse, should be repeated in
recitation in every verse.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> did three
Knights come from the west,<br />
With the high and the lily oh!<br />
And these three Knights courted one ladye,<br />
As the rose was so sweetly blown.<br />
The first Knight came was all in white,<br />
And asked of her if she&rsquo;d be his delight.<br />
The next Knight came was all in green,<br />
And asked of her if she&rsquo;d be his queen.<br />
The third Knight came was all in red,<br />
And asked of her if she would wed.<br />
&lsquo;Then have you asked of my father dear?<br />
Likewise of her who did me bear?<br />
&lsquo;And have you asked of my brother John?<br />
And also of my sister Anne?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve asked of your father dear,<br />
Likewise of her who did you bear.<br />
&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ve asked of your sister Anne,<br />
But I&rsquo;ve not asked of your brother John.&rsquo;<br />
Far on the road as they rode along,<br />
There did they meet with her brother John.<br />
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>She
stoop&egrave;d low to kiss him sweet,<br />

&lsquo;Ride on, ride on,&rsquo; cried the servingman,<br />
&lsquo;Methinks your bride she looks wondrous wan.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;I wish I were on yonder stile,<br />
For there I would sit and bleed awhile.<br />
&lsquo;I wish I were on yonder hill,<br />
There I&rsquo;d alight and make my will.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;What would you give to your father dear?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;The gallant steed which doth me bear.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;What would you give to your mother dear?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;My wedding shift which I do wear.<br />
&lsquo;But she must wash it very clean,<br />
For my heart&rsquo;s blood sticks in every seam.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;What would you give to your sister Anne?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;My gay gold ring, and my feathered fan.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;What would you give to your brother John?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;A rope, and a gallows to hang him on.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;What would you give to your brother John&rsquo;s
wife?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;A widow&rsquo;s weeds, and a quiet life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Percy&rsquo;s</span> copy of <i>The
Beggar&rsquo;s Daughter of Bednall Green</i> is known to be very
incorrect: besides many alterations and improvements which it
received at the hands of the Bishop, it contains no less than
eight stanzas written by Robert Dodsley, the author of <i>The
Economy of Human Life</i>.&nbsp; So far as poetry is concerned,
there cannot be a question that the version in the
<i>Reliques</i> is far superior to the original, which is still a
popular favourite, and a correct copy of which is now given, as
it appears in all the <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>common broadside editions that have
been printed from 1672 to the present time.&nbsp; Although the
original copies have all perished, the ballad has been very
satisfactorily proved by Percy to have been written in the reign
of Elizabeth.&nbsp; The present reprint is from a modern copy,
carefully collated with one in the Bagford Collection,
entitled,</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;The rarest ballad that ever was seen,<br

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">This</span> song&rsquo;s of
a beggar who long lost his sight,<br />
And had a fair daughter, most pleasant and bright,<br />
And many a gallant brave suitor had she,<br />
And none was so comely as pretty Bessee.</p>
<p class="poetry">And though she was of complexion most fair,<br

Then she know not whither or which way to go,<br />

So sad and so heavy was pretty Bessee.</p>
<p class="poetry">She kept on her journey until it was day,<br />
And went unto Rumford, along the highway;<br />
And at the King&rsquo;s Arms entertain&egrave;d was she,<br />
So fair and well favoured was pretty Bessee.</p>

gold,<br />
And in their songs daily her love they extolled:<br />
Her beauty was blaz&egrave;d in every decree,<br />
So fair and so comely was pretty Bessee.</p>
<p class="poetry">The young men of Rumford in her had their
joy,<br />
She showed herself courteous, but never too coy,<br />
And at their commandment still she would be,<br />
So fair and so comely was pretty Bessee.</p>
<p class="poetry">Four suitors at once unto her did go,<br />
They crav&egrave;d her favour, but still she said no;<br />
I would not have gentlemen marry with me!<br />
Yet ever they honour&egrave;d pretty Bessee.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now one of them was a gallant young knight,<br

And he came unto her disguised in the night;<br />
The second, a gentleman of high degree,<br />
Who woo&egrave;d and su&egrave;d for pretty Bessee.</p>
<p class="poetry">A merchant of London, whose wealth was not
small,<br />
Was then the third suitor, and proper withal;<br />
Her master&rsquo;s own son the fourth man must be,<br />
Who swore he would die for pretty Bessee.</p>

&lsquo;I loathe,&rsquo; said the gentleman, &lsquo;a

go.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Nay, forbear,&rsquo; quoth his kinsman, &lsquo;it must not

A poor beggar&rsquo;s daughter a lady shan&rsquo;t be;<br />
Then take thy adieu of thy pretty Bessee.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">As soon then as it was break of the day,<br />
The knight had from Rumford stole Bessee away;<br />
The young men of Rumford, so sick as may be,<br />
Rode after to fetch again pretty Bessee.</p>
<p class="poetry">As swift as the wind to ride they were seen,<br

Until they came near unto Bednall Green,<br />
And as the knight lighted most courteously,<br />
They fought against him for pretty Bessee.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>But rescue came presently over the plain,<br />
Or else the knight there for his love had been slain;<br />
The fray being ended, they straightway did see<br />
His kinsman come railing at pretty Bessee.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then bespoke the blind beggar, &lsquo;Although
I be poor,<br />
Rail not against my child at my own door,<br />
Though she be not deck&egrave;d in velvet and pearl,<br />
Yet I will drop angels with thee for my girl;</p>

birth,<br />
And equal the gold you lay on the earth,<br />
Then neither rail you, nor grudge you to see<br />
The blind beggar&rsquo;s daughter a lady to be.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;But first, I will hear, and have it well

The gold that you drop it shall be all your own.&rsquo;<br />
With that they repli&egrave;d, &lsquo;Contented we be!&rsquo;<br

&lsquo;Then here&rsquo;s,&rsquo; quoth the beggar, &lsquo;for
pretty Bessee!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">With that an angel he dropped on the ground,<br

And dropp&egrave;d, in angels, full three thousand pound;<br />
And oftentimes it proved most plain,<br />
For the gentleman&rsquo;s one, the beggar dropped twain;</p>
<p class="poetry">So that the whole place wherein they did
sit,<br />
With gold was cover&egrave;d every whit.<br />
The gentleman having dropped all his store,<br />
Said, &lsquo;Beggar! your hand hold, for I have no
more.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>THE BOLD PEDLAR AND ROBIN HOOD.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> ballad is of considerable
antiquity, and no doubt much older than some of those inserted in
the common Garlands.&nbsp; It appears to have escaped the notice
of Ritson, Percy, and other collectors of Robin Hood
ballads.&nbsp; The tune is given in <i>Popular Music</i>.&nbsp;
An aged woman in Bermondsey, Surrey, from whose oral recitation
the present version was taken down, said that she had often heard
her grandmother sing it, and that it was never in print; but we
have since met with several common stall copies.&nbsp; The
subject is the same as that of the old ballad called <i>Robin
Hood newly revived</i>; <i>or</i>, <i>the Meeting and Fighting
with his Cousin Scarlett</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> chanced to be
a pedlar bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A pedlar bold he chanced to be;<br />
He rolled his pack all on his back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he came tripping o&rsquo;er the lee.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down, a down, a down, a down,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down, a down, a

&nbsp;&nbsp; Two troublesome blades they chanced to be;<br />
The one of them was bold Robin Hood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the other was Little John, so free.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Oh! pedlar, pedlar, what is in thy
pack,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come speedilie and tell to me?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve several suits of the gay green silks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And silken bowstrings two or three.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;If you have several suits of the gay
green silk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And silken bowstrings two or three,<br />
Then it&rsquo;s by my body,&rsquo; cries <i>bittle</i> John,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;One half your pack shall belong to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh! nay, oh! nay,&rsquo; says the pedlar
bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! nay, oh! nay, that never can be,<br />
For there&rsquo;s never a man from fair Nottingham<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can take one half my pack from me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then the pedlar he pulled off his pack,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And put it a little below his knee,<br />
Saying, &lsquo;If you do move me one perch from this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My pack and all shall gang with thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Little John he drew his sword;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The pedlar by his pack did stand;<br />
They fought until they both did sweat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till he cried, &lsquo;Pedlar, pray hold your
hand!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Robin Hood he was standing by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he did laugh most heartilie,<br />
Saying, &lsquo;I could find a man of a smaller scale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could thrash the pedlar, and also thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Go, you try, master,&rsquo; says Little
John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Go, you try, master, most speedilie,<br />
Or by my body,&rsquo; says Little John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sure this night you will not know
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Robin Hood he drew his sword,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the pedlar by his pack did stand,<br />
They fought till the blood in streams did flow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till he cried, &lsquo;Pedlar, pray hold your
hand!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

For killing a man in my father&rsquo;s land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From my country I was forced to flee.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;If you are Gamble Gold of the gay green
woods,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And travell&egrave;d far beyond the sea,<br />
You are my mother&rsquo;s own sister&rsquo;s son;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What nearer cousins then can we be?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">They sheath&egrave;d their swords with friendly
words,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So merrily they did agree;<br />
They went to a tavern and there they dined,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bottles cracked most merrilie.</p>
<h3>THE OUTLANDISH KNIGHT.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> is the common English stall
copy of a ballad of which there are a variety of versions, for an
account of which, and of the presumed origin of the story, the
reader is referred to the notes on the <i>Water o&rsquo;
Wearie&rsquo;s Well</i>, in the <i>Scottish Traditional Versions
of Ancient Ballads</i>, published by the Percy Society.&nbsp; By
the term &lsquo;outlandish&rsquo; is signified an inhabitant of
that portion of the border which was formerly known by the name
of &lsquo;the Debateable Land,&rsquo; a district which, though
claimed by both England and Scotland, could not be said to belong
to either country.&nbsp; The people on each side of the border
applied the term &lsquo;outlandish&rsquo; to the Debateable
residents.&nbsp; The tune to <i>The Outlandish Knight</i> has
never been printed; it is peculiar to the ballad, and, from its
popularity, is well known.]</p>

<h3>LORD DELAWARE.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">(TRADITIONAL.)</span></p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> interesting traditional
ballad was first published by Mr. Thomas Lyle in his <i>Ancient
Ballads and Songs</i>, London, 1827.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have not as
yet,&rsquo; says Mr. Lyle, &lsquo;been able to trace out the
historical incident upon which this ballad appears to have been
founded; yet those curious in such matters may consult, if they
list, <i>Proceedings and Debates in the House of Commons</i>, for
1621 and 1662, where they will find that some stormy debating in
these several years had been agitated in parliament regarding the
corn laws, which bear pretty close upon the leading features of
the ballad.&rsquo;&nbsp; Does not the ballad, however, belong to
a much earlier period?&nbsp; The description of the combat, the
presence of heralds, the wearing of armour, &amp;c., justify the
conjecture.&nbsp; For De la Ware, ought we not to read De la
Mare? and is not Sir Thomas De la Mare the hero? the De la Mare
who in the reign of Edward III., <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1377, was Speaker of the House of
Commons.&nbsp; <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>All historians are agreed in representing him as a
person using &lsquo;great freedom of speach,&rsquo; and which,
indeed, he carried to such an extent as to endanger his personal
liberty.&nbsp; As bearing somewhat upon the subject of the
ballad, it may he observed that De la Mare was a great advocate
of popular rights, and particularly protested against the
inhabitants of England being subject to &lsquo;purveyance,&rsquo;
asserting that &lsquo;if the royal revenue was faithfully
administered, there could be no necessity for laying burdens on
the people.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the subsequent reign of Richard II,
De In Mare was a prominent character, and though history is
silent on the subject, it is not improbable that such a man
might, even in the royal presence, have defended the rights of
the poor, and spoken in extenuation of the agrarian
insurrectionary movements which were then so prevalent and so
alarming.&nbsp; On the hypothesis of De la Mare being the hero,
there are other incidents in the tale which cannot be reconciled
with history, such as the title given to De la Mare, who
certainly was never ennobled; nor can we ascertain that he was
ever mixed up in any duel; nor does it appear clear who can be
meant by the &lsquo;Welsh Lord, the brave Duke of
Devonshire,&rsquo; that dukedom not having been created till 1694
and no nobleman having derived any title whatever from Devonshire
previously to 1618, when Baron Cavendish, of Hardwick, was
created the first <i>Earl</i> of Devonshire.&nbsp; We may
therefore presume that for &lsquo;Devonshire&rsquo; ought to be
inserted the name of some other county or place.&nbsp; Strict
historical accuracy is, however, hardly to be expected in any
ballad, particularly in one which, like the present, has
evidently been corrupted in floating down the stream of
time.&nbsp; There is only one quarrel recorded at the supposed
period of our tale as having taken place betwixt two noblemen,
and which resulted in a hostile meeting, viz., that wherein the
belligerent parties were the Duke of Hereford (who might by a
&lsquo;ballad-monger&rsquo; be deemed a <i>Welsh</i> lord) and
the Duke of Norfolk.&nbsp; This was in the reign of Richard
II.&nbsp; No fight, however, took place, owing to the
interference of the king.&nbsp; Our minstrel author may have had
rather confused historical ideas, and so mixed up certain
passages in De la Mare&rsquo;s history with this squabble; and we
are strongly inclined to suspect that such is the case, and that
it will be found the real clue to the story.&nbsp; Vide
Hume&rsquo;s <i>History of England</i>, chap. XVII. <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1398.&nbsp; Lyle acknowledges that
he has taken some liberties with the oral version, but does not
state what they were, beyond that they consisted merely in
&lsquo;smoothing down.&rsquo;&nbsp; Would that he had left it
&lsquo;in the <i>rough</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; The last verse has every
appearance of being <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>apocryphal; it looks like one of those benedictory
verses with which minstrels were, and still are, in the habit of
concluding their songs.&nbsp; Lyle says the tune &lsquo;is
pleasing, and peculiar to the ballad.&rsquo;&nbsp; A homely
version, presenting only trivial variations from that of Mr.
Lyle, is still printed and sung.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> the Parliament
House, a great rout has been there,<br />
Betwixt our good King and the Lord Delaware:<br />
Says Lord Delaware to his Majesty full soon,<br />
&lsquo;Will it please you, my liege, to grant me a
boon?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;What&rsquo;s your boon,&rsquo; says the
King, &lsquo;now let me understand?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s, give me all the poor men we&rsquo;ve starving
in this land;<br />
And without delay, I&rsquo;ll hie me to Lincolnshire,<br />
To sow hemp-seed and flax-seed, and hang them all there.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;For with hempen cord it&rsquo;s better
to stop each poor man&rsquo;s breath,<br />
Than with famine you should see your subjects starve to
death.&rsquo;<br />
Up starts a Dutch Lord, who to Delaware did say,<br />
&lsquo;Thou deserves to be stabbed!&rsquo; then he turned himself
away;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Thou deserves to be stabbed, and the
dogs have thine ears,<br />
For insulting our King in this Parliament of peers.&rsquo;<br />
Up sprang a Welsh Lord, the brave Duke of Devonshire,<br />
&lsquo;In young Delaware&rsquo;s defence, I&rsquo;ll fight this
Dutch Lord, my sire;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;For he is in the right, and I&rsquo;ll
make it so appear:<br />
Him I dare to single combat, for insulting Delaware.&rsquo;<br />
A stage was soon erected, and to combat they went,<br />
For to kill, or to be killed, it was either&rsquo;s full
intent.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>But the very first flourish, when the heralds gave
command,<br />
The sword of brave Devonshire bent backward on his hand;<br />
In suspense he paused awhile, scanned his foe before he
strake,<br />
Then against the King&rsquo;s armour, his bent sword he
brake.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then he sprang from the stage, to a soldier in
the ring,<br />
Saying, &lsquo;Lend your sword, that to an end this tragedy we
bring:<br />
Though he&rsquo;s fighting me in armour, while I am fighting
bare,<br />
Even more than this I&rsquo;d venture for young Lord
Delaware.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Leaping back on the stage, sword to buckler now
resounds,<br />
Till he left the Dutch Lord a bleeding in his wounds:<br />
This seeing, cries the King to his guards without delay,<br />
&lsquo;Call Devonshire down,&mdash;take the dead man
away!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;No,&rsquo; says brave Devonshire,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve fought him as a man,<br />
Since he&rsquo;s dead, I will keep the trophies I have won;<br />
For he fought me in your armour, while I fought him bare,<br />
And the same you must win back, my liege, if ever you them
wear.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">God bless the Church of England, may it prosper
on each hand,<br />
And also every poor man now starving in this land;<br />
And while I pray success may crown our King upon his throne,<br
/>
I&rsquo;ll wish that every poor man may long enjoy his own.</p>

west,<br />

<p class="poetry">And in this prison there grew a tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It grew so stout, and grew so strong;<br />
Where he was chain&egrave;d by the middle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Until his life was almost gone.</p>
<p class="poetry">This Turk he had one only daughter,<br />

<h3>THE GOLDEN GLOVE;</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">OR, THE
SQUIRE OF TAMWORTH.</span></p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> is a very popular ballad, and
sung in every part of England.&nbsp; It is traditionally reported
to be founded on an incident which occurred in the reign of
Elizabeth.&nbsp; It has been published in the broadside form from
the commencement of the eighteenth century, but is no doubt much
older.&nbsp; It does not appear to have been previously inserted
in any collection.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>A <span class="smcap">wealthy</span> young squire of
Tamworth, we hear,<br />
He courted a nobleman&rsquo;s daughter so fair;<br />
And for to marry her it was his intent,<br />
All friends and relations gave their consent.</p>
<p class="poetry">The time was appointed for the wedding-day,<br

A young farmer chosen to give her away;<br />
As soon as the farmer the young lady did spy,<br />
He inflam&egrave;d her heart; &lsquo;O, my heart!&rsquo; she did
cry.</p>
<p class="poetry">She turned from the squire, but nothing she
said,<br />
Instead of being married she took to her bed;<br />
The thought of the farmer soon run in her mind,<br />
A way for to have him she quickly did find.</p>
<p class="poetry">Coat, waistcoat, and breeches she then did put
on,<br />
And a hunting she went with her dog and her gun;<br />
She hunted all round where the farmer did dwell,<br />
Because in her heart she did love him full well:</p>
<p class="poetry">She oftentimes fired, but nothing she
killed,<br />
At length the young farmer came into the field;<br />
And to discourse with him it was her intent,<br />
With her dog and her gun to meet him she went.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I thought you had been at the
wedding,&rsquo; she cried,<br />
&lsquo;To wait on the squire, and give him his bride.&rsquo;<br

&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; said the farmer, &lsquo;if the truth I may
tell,<br />
I&rsquo;ll not give her away, for I love her too well&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Suppose that the lady should grant you
her love,<br />
You know that the squire your rival will prove.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Why, then,&rsquo; says the farmer, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take
sword in hand,<br />
By honour I&rsquo;ll gain her when she shall command.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">It pleas&egrave;d the lady to find him so
bold;<br />
She gave him a glove that was flowered with gold,<br />

As she was a hunting with her dog and gun.</p>
<p class="poetry">The lady went home with a heart full of
love,<br />
And gave out a notice that she&rsquo;d lost a glove;<br />
And said, &lsquo;Who has found it, and brings it to me,<br />
Whoever he is, he my husband shall be.&rsquo;</p>

And hope you&rsquo;ll be pleased to grant me your
love.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s already granted, I will be
your bride;<br />
I love the sweet breath of a farmer,&rsquo; she cried.<br />
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be mistress of my dairy, and milking my cow,<br

While my jolly brisk farmer is whistling at plough.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And when she was married she told of her

<h3>KING JAMES I. AND THE TINKLER. <a name="citation72a"></a><a
href="#footnote72a" class="citation">[72a]</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">(TRADITIONAL.)</span></p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> ballad of <i>King James I.
and the Tinkler</i> was probably written either in, or shortly
after, the reign of the monarch who is the hero.&nbsp; The
incident recorded is said to be a fact, though the locality is
doubtful.&nbsp; By some the scene is laid at Norwood, in Surrey;
by others in some part of the English border.&nbsp; The ballad is
alluded to by Percy, but is not inserted either in the
<i>Reliques</i>, or in any other popular collection.&nbsp; It is
to be found only in a few broadsides and chap-books of modern
date.&nbsp; The present version is a traditional one, taken down,
as here given, from the recital of the late Francis King. <a
name="citation72b"></a><a href="#footnote72b"
class="citation">[72b]</a>&nbsp; It is much superior to the <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>common
broadside edition with which it has been collated, and from which
the thirteenth and fifteenth verses were obtained.&nbsp; The
ballad is very popular on the Border, and in the dales of
Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Craven.&nbsp; The late Robert
Anderson, the Cumbrian bard, represents Deavie, in his song of
the <i>Clay Daubin</i>, as singing <i>The King and the
Tinkler</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">And</span> now, to be
brief, let&rsquo;s pass over the rest,<br />
Who seldom or never were given to jest,<br />
And come to King Jamie, the first of our throne,<br />
A pleasanter monarch sure never was known.</p>
<p class="poetry">As he was a hunting the swift fallow-deer,<br
/>
He dropped all his nobles; and when he got clear,<br />
In hope of some pastime away he did ride,<br />
Till he came to an alehouse, hard by a wood-side.</p>
<p class="poetry">And there with a tinkler he happened to
meet,<br />
And him in kind sort he so freely did greet:<br />
&lsquo;Pray thee, good fellow, what hast in thy jug,<br />
Which under thy arm thou dost lovingly hug?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;By the mass!&rsquo; quoth the tinkler,
&lsquo;it&rsquo;s nappy brown ale,<br />
And for to drink to thee, friend, I will not fail;<br />
For although thy jacket looks gallant and fine,<br />
I think that my twopence as good is as thine.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;By my soul! honest fellow, the truth
thou hast spoke,&rsquo;<br />
And straight he sat down with the tinkler to joke;<br />
They drank to the King, and they pledged to each other;<br />
Who&rsquo;d seen &rsquo;em had thought they were brother and
brother.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>As they were a-drinking the King pleased to say,<br />
&lsquo;What news, honest fellow? come tell me, I pray?&rsquo;<br
/>
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing of news, beyond that I hear<br />
The King&rsquo;s on the border a-chasing the deer.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;And truly I wish I so happy may be<br />
Whilst he is a hunting the King I might see;<br />
For although I&rsquo;ve travelled the land many ways<br />
I never have yet seen a King in my days.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The King, with a hearty brisk laughter,
replied,<br />
&lsquo;I tell thee, good fellow, if thou canst but ride,<br />
Thou shalt get up behind me, and I will thee bring<br />
To the presence of Jamie, thy sovereign King.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;But he&rsquo;ll be surrounded with
nobles so gay,<br />
And how shall we tell him from them, sir, I pray?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Thou&rsquo;lt easily ken him when once thou art there;<br
/>
The King will be covered, his nobles all bare.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">He got up behind him and likewise his sack,<br
/>
His budget of leather, and tools at his back;<br />
They rode till they came to the merry greenwood,<br />
His nobles came round him, bareheaded they stood.</p>
<p class="poetry">The tinkler then seeing so many appear,<br />
He slily did whisper the King in his ear:<br />
Saying, &lsquo;They&rsquo;re all clothed so gloriously gay,<br />
But which amongst them is the King, sir, I pray?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The King did with hearty good laughter,
reply,<br />
&lsquo;By my soul! my good fellow, it&rsquo;s thou or it&rsquo;s
I!<br />
The rest are bareheaded, uncovered all round.&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
With his bag and his budget he fell to the ground,</p>
<p class="poetry">Like one that was frightened quite out of his
wits,<br />
Then on his knees he instantly gets,<br />
Beseeching for mercy; the King to him said,<br />
&lsquo;Thou art a good fellow, so be not afraid.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Come, tell thy name?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am John of the Dale,<br />
A mender of kettles, a lover of ale.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Rise up, Sir John, I will honour thee here,&mdash;<br />
I make thee a knight of three thousand a year!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>This was a good thing for the tinkler indeed;<br />
Then unto the court he was sent for with speed,<br />
Where great store of pleasure and pastime was seen,<br />
In the royal presence of King and of Queen.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sir John of the Dale he has land, he has
fee,<br />
At the court of the king who so happy as he?<br />
Yet still in his hall hangs the tinkler&rsquo;s old sack,<br />
And the budget of tools which he bore at his back.</p>
<h3>THE KEACH I&rsquo; THE CREEL.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> old and very humorous ballad
has long been a favourite on both sides of the Border, but had
never appeared in print till about 1845, when a Northumbrian
gentleman printed a few copies for private circulation, from one
of which the following is taken.&nbsp; In the present impression
some trifling typographical mistakes are corrected, and the
phraseology has been rendered uniform throughout.&nbsp; <i>Keach

<h3>THE MERRY BROOMFIELD; OR, THE WEST COUNTRY WAGER.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> old West-country ballad was
one of the broadsides printed at the Aldermary press.&nbsp; We
have not met with any older impression, <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>though we
have been assured that there are black-letter copies.&nbsp; In
Scott&rsquo;s <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i> is a
ballad called the <i>Broomfield Hill</i>; it is a mere fragment,
but is evidently taken from the present ballad, and can be
considered only as one of the many modern antiques to be found in
that work.]</p>
<p class="poetry">A <span class="smcap">noble</span> young squire
that lived in the West,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He courted a young lady gay;<br />
And as he was merry he put forth a jest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A wager with her he would lay.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;A wager with me,&rsquo; the young lady
replied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I pray about what must it be?<br />
If I like the humour you shan&rsquo;t be denied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I love to be merry and free.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Quoth he, &lsquo;I will lay you a hundred
pounds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A hundred pounds, aye, and ten,<br />
That a maid if you go to the merry Broomfield,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That a maid you return not again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll lay you that wager,&rsquo;
the lady she said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the money she flung down amain;<br />
&lsquo;To the merry Broomfield I&rsquo;ll go a pure maid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The same I&rsquo;ll return home again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">He covered her bet in the midst of the hall,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a hundred and ten jolly pounds;<br />
And then to his servant he straightway did call,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For to bring forth his hawk and his hounds.</p>
<p class="poetry">A ready obedience the servant did yield,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all was made ready o&rsquo;er night;<br />
Next morning he went to the merry Broomfield,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet with his love and delight.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now when he came there, having waited a
while,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the green broom down he lies;<br />
The lady came to him, and could not but smile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For sleep then had clos&egrave;d his eyes.</p>
<p class="poetry">Upon his right hand a gold ring she secured,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawn from her own fingers so fair;<br />
That when he awak&egrave;d he might be assured<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His lady and love had been there.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>She left him a posie of pleasant perfume,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then stepped from the place where he lay,<br />
Then hid herself close in the besom of broom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To hear what her true love did say.</p>
<p class="poetry">He wakened and found the gold ring on his
hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then sorrow of heart he was in;<br />
&lsquo;My love has been here, I do well understand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And this wager I now shall not win.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Oh! where was you, my goodly goshawk,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The which I have purchased so dear,<br />
Why did you not waken me out of my sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the lady, my love, was here?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;O! with my bells did I ring, master,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And eke with my feet did I run;<br />
And still did I cry, pray awake! master,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;s here now, and soon will be
gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;O! where was you, my gallant
greyhound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose collar is flourished with gold;<br />
Why hadst thou not wakened me out of my sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When thou didst my lady behold?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Dear master, I barked with my mouth when
she came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And likewise my collar I shook;<br />
And told you that here was the beautiful dame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But no notice of me then you took.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;O! where wast thou, my servingman,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom I have cloth&egrave;d so fine?<br />
If you had waked me when she was here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wager then had been mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">In the night you should have slept, master,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kept awake in the day;<br />
Had you not been sleeping when hither she came,<br />

<h3>SIR JOHN BARLEYCORN.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> West-country ballad of <i>Sir
John Barleycorn</i> is very ancient, and being the only version
that has ever been sung at English merry-makings and country
feasts, can certainly set up a better claim to antiquity than any
of the three ballads on the same subject to be found in
Evans&rsquo;s <i>Old Ballads</i>; viz., <i>John Barleycorn</i>,
<i>The Little Barleycorn</i>, and <i>Mas Mault</i>.&nbsp; Our
west-country version bears the greatest resemblance to <i>The
Little Barleycorn</i>, but it is very dissimilar to any of the
three.&nbsp; Burns altered the old ditty, but on referring to his
version it will be seen that his corrections and additions want
the simplicity of the original, and certainly cannot be
considered improvements.&nbsp; The common ballad does not appear
to have been inserted in any of our popular collections.&nbsp;
<i>Sir John Barleycorn</i> is very appropriately sung to the tune
of <i>Stingo</i>.&nbsp; See <i>Popular Music</i>, p. 305.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> came three men
out of the West,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their victory to try;<br />
And they have taken a solemn oath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Barleycorn should die.</p>
<p class="poetry">They took a plough and ploughed him in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And harrowed clods on his head;<br />
And then they took a solemn oath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Barleycorn was dead.</p>
<p class="poetry">There he lay sleeping in the ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till rain from the sky did fall:<br />
Then Barleycorn sprung up his head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so amazed them all.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>There he remained till Midsummer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And looked both pale and wan;<br />
Then Barleycorn he got a beard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so became a man.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then they sent men with scythes so sharp,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To cut him off at knee;<br />
And then poor little Barleycorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They served him barbarously.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then they sent men with pitchforks strong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To pierce him through the heart;<br />
And like a dreadful tragedy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They bound him to a cart.</p>
<p class="poetry">And then they brought him to a barn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A prisoner to endure;<br />
And so they fetched him out again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And laid him on the floor.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then they set men with holly clubs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To beat the flesh from his bones;<br />
But the miller he served him worse than that,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he ground him betwixt two stones.</p>
<p class="poetry">O! Barleycorn is the choicest grain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That ever was sown on land;<br />
It will do more than any grain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the turning of your hand.</p>
<p class="poetry">It will make a boy into a man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a man into an ass;<br />
It will change your gold into silver,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And your silver into brass.</p>
<p class="poetry">It will make the huntsman hunt the fox,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That never wound his horn;<br />
It will bring the tinker to the stocks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That people may him scorn.</p>
<p class="poetry">It will put sack into a glass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And claret in the can;<br />
And it will cause a man to drink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till he neither can go nor stand.</p>

THE WINDS, I-HO!</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> Northumbrian ballad is of
great antiquity, and bears considerable resemblance to <i>The
Baffled Knight</i>; <i>or</i>, <i>Lady&rsquo;s Policy</i>,
inserted in Percy&rsquo;s <i>Reliques</i>.&nbsp; It is not in any
popular collection.&nbsp; In the broadside from which it is here
printed, the title and chorus are given, <i>Blow the Winds</i>,
<i>I-O</i>, a form common to many ballads and songs, but only to
those of great antiquity.&nbsp; Chappell, in his <i>Popular
Music</i>, has an example in a song as old as 1698:&mdash;</p>

&lsquo;I-ho!&rsquo; was an ancient form of acclamation or triumph
on joyful occasions and anniversaries.&nbsp; It is common, with
slight variations, to different languages.&nbsp; In the Gothic,
for example, Iola signifies to make merry.&nbsp; It has been
supposed by some etymologists that the word &lsquo;yule&rsquo; is
a corruption of &lsquo;Io!&rsquo;]</p>

<h3>THE BEAUTIFUL LADY OF KENT;</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">OR, THE
SEAMAN OF DOVER.</span></p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">We</span> have met with two copies of
this genuine English ballad; the older one is without
printer&rsquo;s name, but from the appearance of the type and the
paper, it must have been published about the middle of the last
century.&nbsp; It is certainly not one of the original
impressions, for the other copy, though of recent date, has
evidently been taken from some still older and better
edition.&nbsp; In the modern broadside the ballad is in four
parts, whereas, in our older one, there is no such expressed
division, but a word at the commencement of each part is printed
in capital letters.]</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PART I.</p>
<p class="poetry">A <span class="smcap">seaman</span> of Dover,
whose excellent parts,<br />
For wisdom and learning, had conquered the hearts<br />
Of many young damsels, of beauty so bright,<br />
Of him this new ditty in brief I shall write;</p>
<p class="poetry">And show of his turnings, and windings of
fate,<br />
His passions and sorrows, so many and great:<br />
And how he was bless&egrave;d with true love at last,<br />
When all the rough storms of his troubles were past.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, to be brief, I shall tell you the
truth:<br />
A beautiful lady, whose name it was Ruth,<br />
A squire&rsquo;s young daughter, near Sandwich, in Kent,<br />
Proves all his heart&rsquo;s treasure, his joy and content.</p>
<p class="poetry">Unknown to their parents in private they
meet,<br />
Where many love lessons they&rsquo;d often repeat,<br />
With kisses, and many embraces likewise,<br />
She granted him love, and thus gain&egrave;d the prize.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>She said, &lsquo;I consent to be thy sweet bride,<br />
Whatever becomes of my fortune,&rsquo; she cried.<br />
&lsquo;The frowns of my father I never will fear,<br />
But freely will go through the world with my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">A jewel he gave her, in token of love,<br />
And vowed, by the sacred powers above,<br />
To wed the next morning; but they were betrayed,<br />
And all by the means of a treacherous maid.</p>
<p class="poetry">She told her parents that they were agreed:<br
/>
With that they fell into a passion with speed,<br />
And said, ere a seaman their daughter should have,<br />
They rather would follow her corpse to the grave.</p>
<p class="poetry">The lady was straight to her chamber
confined,<br />
Here long she continued in sorrow of mind,<br />
And so did her love, for the loss of his dear,&mdash;<br />
No sorrow was ever so sharp and severe.</p>
<p class="poetry">When long he had mourned for his love and
delight,<br />
Close under the window he came in the night,<br />
And sung forth this ditty:&mdash;&lsquo;My dearest, farewell!<br
/>
Behold, in this nation no longer I dwell.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I am going from hence to the kingdom of
Spain,<br />
Because I am willing that you should obtain<br />
Your freedom once more; for my heart it will break<br />
If longer thou liest confined for my sake.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The words which he uttered, they caused her to
weep;<br />
Yet, nevertheless, she was forc&egrave;d to keep<br />
Deep silence that minute, that minute for fear<br />
Her honour&egrave;d father and mother should hear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PART II.</p>
<p class="poetry">Soon after, bold Henry he entered on board,<br
/>
The heavens a prosperous gale did afford,<br />
And brought him with speed to the kingdom of Spain,<br />
There he with a merchant some time did remain;</p>
<p class="poetry">Who, finding that he was both faithful and
just,<br />
Preferred him to places of honour and trust;<br />
<a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>He made
him as great as his heart could request,<br />
Yet, wanting his Ruth, he with grief was oppressed.</p>
<p class="poetry">So great was his grief it could not be
concealed,<br />
Both honour and riches no pleasure could yield;<br />
In private he often would weep and lament,<br />
For Ruth, the fair, beautiful lady of Kent.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, while he lamented the loss of his dear,<br
/>
A lady of Spain did before him appear,<br />
Bedecked with rich jewels both costly and gay,<br />
Who earnestly sought for his favour that day.</p>
<p class="poetry">Said she, &lsquo;Gentle swain, I am wounded
with love,<br />
And you are the person I honour above<br />
The greatest of nobles that ever was born;&mdash;<br />
Then pity my tears, and my sorrowful mourn!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I pity thy sorrowful tears,&rsquo; he
replied,<br />
&lsquo;And wish I were worthy to make thee my bride;<br />
But, lady, thy grandeur is greater than mine,<br />
Therefore, I am fearful my heart to resign.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;O! never be doubtful of what will
ensue,<br />
No manner of danger will happen to you;<br />
At my own disposal I am, I declare,<br />
Receive me with love, or destroy me with care.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Dear madam, don&rsquo;t fix your
affection on me,<br />
You are fit for some lord of a noble degree,<br />
That is able to keep up your honour and fame;<br />
I am but a poor sailor, from England who came.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;A man of mean fortune, whose substance
is small,<br />
I have not wherewith to maintain you withal,<br />
Sweet lady, according to honour and state;<br />
Now this is the truth, which I freely relate.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The lady she lovingly squeez&egrave;d his
hand,<br />
And said with a smile, &lsquo;Ever blessed be the land<br />
That bred such a noble, brave seaman as thee;<br />
I value no honours, thou&rsquo;rt welcome to me;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&lsquo;My parents are dead, I have jewels untold,<br />
Besides in possession a million of gold;<br />
And thou shalt be lord of whatever I have,<br />
Grant me but thy love, which I earnestly crave.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then, turning aside, to himself he replied,<br
/>
&lsquo;I am courted with riches and beauty beside;<br />
This love I may have, but my Ruth is denied.&rsquo;<br />
Wherefore he consented to make her his bride.</p>
<p class="poetry">The lady she cloth&egrave;d him costly and
great;<br />
His noble deportment, both proper and straight,<br />
So charm&egrave;d the innocent eye of his dove,<br />
And added a second new flame to her love.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then married they were without longer delay;<br
/>
Now here we will leave them both glorious and gay,<br />
To speak of fair Ruth, who in sorrow was left<br />
At home with her parents, of comfort bereft.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PART III.</p>
<p class="poetry">When under the window with an aching heart,<br
/>
He told his fair Ruth he so soon must depart,<br />
Her parents they heard, and well pleas&egrave;d they were,<br />
But Ruth was afflicted with sorrow and care.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, after her lover had quitted the shore,<br
/>
They kept her confined a fall twelvemonth or more,<br />
And then they were pleas&egrave;d to set her at large,<br />
With laying upon her a wonderful charge:</p>
<p class="poetry">To fly from a seaman as she would from
death;<br />
She promised she would, with a faltering breath;<br />
Yet, nevertheless, the truth you shall hear,<br />
She found out a way for to follow her dear.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then, taking her gold and her silver
als&ograve;,<br />
In seaman&rsquo;s apparel away she did go,<br />
And found out a master, with whom she agreed,<br />
To carry her over the ocean with speed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, when she arrived at the kingdom of
Spain,<br />
From city to city she travelled amain,<br />
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Enquiring
about everywhere for her love,<br />
Who now had been gone seven years and above.</p>
<p class="poetry">In Cadiz, as she walked along in the street,<br
/>
Her love and his lady she happened to meet,<br />
But in such a garb as she never had seen,&mdash;<br />
She looked like an angel, or beautiful queen.</p>
<p class="poetry">With sorrowful tears she turned her aside:<br
/>
&lsquo;My jewel is gone, I shall ne&rsquo;er be his bride;<br />
But, nevertheless, though my hopes are in vain,<br />
I&rsquo;ll never return to old England again.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;But here, in this place, I will now be
confined;<br />
It will be a comfort and joy to my mind,<br />
To see him sometimes, though he thinks not of me,<br />
Since he has a lady of noble degree.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, while in the city fair Ruth did reside,<br
/>
Of a sudden this beautiful lady she died,<br />
And, though he was in the possession of all,<br />
Yet tears from his eyes in abundance did fall.</p>
<p class="poetry">As he was expressing his piteous moan,<br />
Fair Ruth came unto him, and made herself known;<br />
He started to see her, but seem&egrave;d not coy,<br />
Said he, &lsquo;Now my sorrows are mingled with joy!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The time of the mourning he kept it in
Spain,<br />
And then he came back to old England again,<br />
With thousands, and thousands, which he did possess;<br />
Then glorious and gay was sweet Ruth in her dress.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PART IV.</p>
<p class="poetry">When over the seas to fair Sandwich he came,<br

With Ruth, and a number of persons of fame,<br />
Then all did appear most splendid and gay,<br />
As if it had been a great festival day.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, when that they took up their lodgings,
behold!<br />
He stripped off his coat of embroider&egrave;d gold,<br />
And presently borrows a mariner&rsquo;s suit,<br />
That he with her parents might have some dispute,</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>Before they were sensible he was so great;<br />
And when he came in and knocked at the gate,<br />

<p class="poetry">To them, with obeisance, he modestly said,<br

&lsquo;Pray where is my jewel, that innocent maid,<br />
Whose sweet lovely beauty doth thousands excel?<br />
I fear, by your weeping, that all is not well!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;No, no! she is gone, she is utterly
lost;<br />
We have not heard of her a twelvemonth at most!<br />
Which makes us distracted with sorrow and care,<br />
And drowns us in tears at the point of despair.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m griev&egrave;d to hear these
sad tidings,&rsquo; he cried.<br />
&lsquo;Alas! honest young man,&rsquo; her father replied,<br />
&lsquo;I heartily wish she&rsquo;d been wedded to you,<br />
For then we this sorrow had never gone through.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Sweet Henry he made them this answer again;<br

&lsquo;I am newly come home from the kingdom of Spain,<br />
From whence I have brought me a beautiful bride,<br />
And am to be married to-morrow,&rsquo; he cried;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;And if you will go to my wedding,&rsquo;
said he,<br />
&lsquo;Both you and your lady right welcome shall be.&rsquo;<br
/>
They promised they would, and accordingly came,<br />
Not thinking to meet with such persons of fame.</p>
<p class="poetry">All decked with their jewels of rubies and
pearls,<br />
As equal companions of lords and of earls,<br />
Fair Ruth, with her love, was as gay as the rest,<br />
So they in their marriage were happily blessed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, as they returned from the church to an
inn,<br />
The father and mother of Ruth did begin<br />
Their daughter to know, by a mole they behold,<br />
Although she was clothed in a garment of gold.</p>
<p class="poetry">With transports of joy they flew to the
bride,<br />
&lsquo;O! where hast thou been, sweetest daughter?&rsquo; they
cried,<br />
&lsquo;Thy tedious absence has griev&egrave;d us sore,<br />
As fearing, alas! we should see thee no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&lsquo;Dear parents,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;many
hazards I run,<br />
To fetch home my love, and your dutiful son;<br />
Receive him with joy, for &rsquo;tis very well known,<br />
He seeks not your wealth, he&rsquo;s enough of his
own.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Her father replied, and he merrily smiled,<br

&lsquo;He&rsquo;s brought home enough, as he&rsquo;s brought home
my child;<br />
A thousand times welcome you are, I declare,<br />
Whose presence disperses both sorrow and care.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Full seven long days in feasting they spent;<br

The bells in the steeple they merrily went,<br />
And many fair pounds were bestowed on the poor,&mdash;<br />
The like of this wedding was never before!</p>
<h3>THE BERKSHIRE LADY&rsquo;S GARLAND.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">IN FOUR
PARTS.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">To the tune of <i>The Royal
Forester</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">When</span> we first met with this very
pleasing English ballad, we deemed the story to be wholly
fictitious, but &lsquo;strange&rsquo; as the
&lsquo;relation&rsquo; may appear, the incidents narrated are
&lsquo;true&rsquo; or at least founded on fact.&nbsp; The scene
of the ballad is Whitley Park, near Reading, in Berkshire, and
not, as some suppose, Calcot House, which was not built till
1759.&nbsp; Whitley is mentioned as &lsquo;the Abbot&rsquo;s
Park, being at the entrance of Redding town.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the
Dissolution the estate passed to the crown, and the mansion
seems, from time to time, to have been used as a royal
&lsquo;palace&rsquo; till the reign of Elizabeth, by whom it was
granted, along with the estate, to Sir Francis Knollys; it was
afterwards, by purchase, the property of the Kendricks, an
ancient race, descended from the Saxon kings.&nbsp; William
Kendrick, of Whitley, armr. was created a baronet in 1679, and
died in 1685, leaving issue one son, Sir William Kendrick, of
Whitley, Bart., who married Miss Mary House, of Reading, and died
in 1699, without issue male, leaving an only daughter.&nbsp; It
was this rich heiress, who possessed &lsquo;store of wealth and
beauty bright,&rsquo; that is the heroine of the ballad.&nbsp;
She married Benjamin Child, Esq., a young and handsome, but very
poor attorney of Reading, and the marriage is traditionally
reported to have been brought about exactly as related in the
ballad.&nbsp; We have not been able to ascertain the exact date
of the marriage, which was celebrated in St. Mary&rsquo;s <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Church,
Reading, the bride wearing a thick veil; but the ceremony must
have taken place some time about 1705.&nbsp; In 1714, Mr. Child
was high sheriff of Berkshire.&nbsp; As he was an humble and
obscure personage previously to his espousing the heiress of
Whitley, and, in fact, owed all his wealth and influence to his
marriage, it cannot be supposed that <i>immediately</i> after his
union he would be elevated to so important and dignified a post
as the high-shrievalty of the very aristocratical county of
Berks.&nbsp; We may, therefore, consider nine or ten years to
have elapsed betwixt his marriage and his holding the office of
high sheriff, which he filled when he was about thirty-two years
of age.&nbsp; The author of the ballad is unknown: supposing him
to have composed it shortly after the events which he records, we
cannot be far wrong in fixing its date about 1706.&nbsp; The
earliest broadside we have seen contains a rudely executed, but
by no means bad likeness of Queen Anne, the reigning monarch at
that period.]</p>

NOBLEMAN&rsquo;S GENEROUS KINDNESS.</h3>
<p>Giving an account of a nobleman, who, taking notice of a poor
man&rsquo;s industrious care and pains for the maintaining of his
charge of seven small children, met him upon a day, and
discoursing with him, invited him, and his wife and his children,
home to his house, and bestowed upon them a farm of thirty acres
of land, to be continued to him and his heirs for ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">To the tune of <i>The Two English
Travellers</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> still popular ballad is
entitled in the modern copies, <i>The Nobleman and Thrasher</i>;
<i>or</i>, <i>the Generous Gift</i>.&nbsp; There is a copy
preserved in the Roxburgh Collection, with which our version has
been collated.&nbsp; It is taken from a broadside printed by
Robert Marchbank, in the Custom-house Entry, Newcastle.]</p>
<p class="poetry">A <span class="smcap">nobleman</span> lived in
a village of late,<br />
Hard by a poor thrasher, whose charge it was great;<br />
For he had seven children, and most of them small,<br />
And nought but his labour to support them withal.</p>
<p class="poetry">He never was given to idle and lurk,<br />
For this nobleman saw him go daily to work,<br />
With his flail and his bag, and his bottle of beer,<br />
As cheerful as those that have hundreds a year.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus careful, and constant, each morning he
went,<br />
Unto his daily labour with joy and content;<br />
So jocular and jolly he&rsquo;d whistle and sing,<br />
As blithe and as brisk as the birds in the spring.</p>
<p class="poetry">One morning, this nobleman taking a walk,<br />
He met this poor man, and he freely did talk;<br />
He asked him [at first] many questions at large,<br />
And then began talking concerning his charge.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Thou hast many children, I very well
know,<br />
Thy labour is hard, and thy wages are low,<br />
And yet thou art cheerful; I pray tell me true,<br />
How can you maintain them as well as you do?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I carefully carry home what I do
earn,<br />
My daily expenses by this I do learn;<br />
And find it is possible, though we be poor,<br />
To still keep the ravenous wolf from the door.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>&lsquo;I reap and I mow, and I harrow and sow,<br />
Sometimes a hedging and ditching I go;<br />
No work comes amiss, for I thrash, and I plough,<br />
Thus my bread I do earn by the sweat of my brow.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;My wife she is willing to pull in a
yoke,<br />
We live like two lambs, nor each other provoke;<br />
We both of us strive, like the labouring ant,<br />
And do our endeavours to keep us from want.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;And when I come home from my labour at
night,<br />
To my wife and my children, in whom I delight;<br />
To see them come round me with prattling noise,&mdash;<br />
Now these are the riches a poor man enjoys.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Though I am as weary as weary may be,<br
/>
The youngest I commonly dance on my knee;<br />
I find that content is a moderate feast,<br />
I never repine at my lot in the least.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Now the nobleman hearing what he did say,<br />
Was pleased, and invited him home the next day;<br />
His wife and his children he charged him to bring;<br />
In token of favour he gave him a ring.</p>
<p class="poetry">He thank&egrave;d his honour, and taking his
leave,<br />
He went to his wife, who would hardly believe<br />
But this same story himself he might raise;<br />
Yet seeing the ring she was [lost] in amaze.</p>
<p class="poetry">Betimes in the morning the good wife she
arose,<br />
And made them all fine, in the best of their clothes;<br />
The good man with his good wife, and children small,<br />
They all went to dine at the nobleman&rsquo;s hall.</p>
<p class="poetry">But when they came there, as truth does
report,<br />
All things were prepared in a plentiful sort;<br />
And they at the nobleman&rsquo;s table did dine,<br />
With all kinds of dainties, and plenty of wine.</p>
<p class="poetry">The feast being over, he soon let them know,<br
/>
That he then intended on them to bestow<br />
A farm-house, with thirty good acres of land;<br />
And gave them the writings then, with his own hand.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&lsquo;Because thou art careful, and good to thy
wife,<br />
I&rsquo;ll make thy days happy the rest of thy life;<br />
It shall be for ever, for thee and thy heirs,<br />
Because I beheld thy industrious cares.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">No tongue then is able in full to express<br />
The depth of their joy, and true thankfulness;<br />
With many a curtsey, and bow to the ground,&mdash;<br />
Such noblemen there are but few to be found.</p>
<h3>THE DRUNKARD&rsquo;S LEGACY.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">IN THREE
PARTS.</span></p>
<p>First, giving an account of a gentlemen a having a wild son,
and who, foreseeing he would come to poverty, had a cottage built
with one door to it, always kept fast; and how, on his dying bed,
he charged him not to open it till he was poor and slighted,
which the young man promised he would perform.&nbsp; Secondly, of
the young man&rsquo;s pawning his estate to a vintner, who, when
poor, kicked him out of doors; when thinking it time to see his
legacy, he broke open the cottage door, where instead of money he
found a gibbet and halter, which he put round his neck, and
jumping off the stool, the gibbet broke, and a thousand pounds
came down upon his head, which lay hid in the ceiling.&nbsp;
Thirdly, of his redeeming his estate, and fooling the vintner out
of two hundred pounds; who, for being jeered by his neighbours,
cut his own throat.&nbsp; And lastly, of the young man&rsquo;s
reformation.&nbsp; Very proper to be read by all who are given to
drunkenness.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Percy</span>, in the introductory remarks
to the ballad of <i>The Heir of Linne</i>, says, &lsquo;the
original of this ballad [<i>The Heir of Linne</i>] is found in
the editor&rsquo;s folio MS.; the breaches and defects of which
rendered the insertion of supplemental stanzas necessary.&nbsp;
These it is hoped the reader will pardon, as, indeed, the
completion of the story was suggested by a modern ballad on a
similar subject.&rsquo;&nbsp; The ballad thus alluded to by Percy
is <i>The Drunkard&rsquo;s Legacy</i>, which, it may be remarked,
although styled by him a <i>modern</i> ballad, is only so
comparatively speaking; for it must have been written long
anterior to Percy&rsquo;s time, and, by his own admission, must
be older than the latter portion of the <i>Heir of
Linne</i>.&nbsp; Our copy is taken from an old chap-book, without
date or printer&rsquo;s name, and which is decorated with three
rudely executed wood-cuts.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Young</span> people all, I
pray draw near,<br />
And listen to my ditty here;<br />
Which subject shows that drunkenness<br />
Brings many mortals to distress!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>As, for example, now I can<br />
Tell you of one, a gentleman,<br />
Who had a very good estate,<br />
His earthly travails they were great.</p>
<p class="poetry">We understand he had one son<br />
Who a lewd wicked race did run;<br />
He daily spent his father&rsquo;s store,<br />
When moneyless, he came for more.</p>
<p class="poetry">The father oftentimes with tears,<br />
Would this alarm sound in his ears;<br />
&lsquo;Son! thou dost all my comfort blast,<br />
And thou wilt come to want at last.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The son these words did little mind,<br />
To cards and dice he was inclined;<br />
Feeding his drunken appetite<br />
In taverns, which was his delight.</p>
<p class="poetry">The father, ere it was too late,<br />
He had a project in his pate,<br />
Before his ag&egrave;d days were run,<br />
To make provision for his son.</p>
<p class="poetry">Near to his house, we understand,<br />
He had a waste plat of land,<br />
Which did but little profit yield,<br />
On which he did a cottage build.</p>
<p class="poetry">The <i>Wise Man&rsquo;s Project</i> was its
name;<br />
There were few windows in the same;<br />
Only one door, substantial thing,<br />
Shut by a lock, went by a spring.</p>
<p class="poetry">Soon after he had played this trick,<br />
It was his lot for to fall sick;<br />
As on his bed he did lament,<br />
Then for his drunken son he sent.</p>
<p class="poetry">He shortly came to his bedside;<br />
Seeing his son, he thus replied:<br />
&lsquo;I have sent for you to make my will,<br />
Which you must faithfully fulfil.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>&lsquo;In such a cottage is one door,<br />
Ne&rsquo;er open it, do thou be sure,<br />
Until thou art so poor, that all<br />
Do then despise you, great and small.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;For, to my grief, I do perceive,<br />
When I am dead, this life you live<br />
Will soon melt all thou hast away;<br />
Do not forget these words, I pray.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;When thou hast made thy friends thy
foes,<br />
Pawned all thy lands, and sold thy clothes;<br />
Break ope the door, and there depend<br />
To find something thy griefs to end.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">This being spoke, the son did say,<br />
&lsquo;Your dying words I will obey.&rsquo;<br />
Soon after this his father dear<br />
Did die, and buried was, we hear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PART II.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, pray observe the second part,<br />
And you shall hear his sottish heart;<br />
He did the tavern so frequent,<br />
Till he three hundred pounds had spent.</p>
<p class="poetry">This being done, we understand<br />
He pawned the deeds of all his land<br />
Unto a tavern-keeper, who,<br />
When poor, did him no favour show.</p>
<p class="poetry">For, to fulfil his father&rsquo;s will,<br />
He did command this cottage still:<br />
At length great sorrow was his share,<br />
Quite moneyless, with garments bare.</p>
<p class="poetry">Being not able for to work,<br />
He in the tavern there did lurk;<br />
From box to box, among rich men,<br />
Who oftentimes reviled him then.</p>
<p class="poetry">To see him sneak so up and down,<br />
The vintner on him he did frown;<br />
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>And one
night kicked him out of door,<br />
Charging him to come there no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">He in a stall did lie all night,<br />
In this most sad and wretched plight;<br />
Then thought it was high time to see<br />
His father&rsquo;s promised legacy.</p>
<p class="poetry">Next morning, then, oppressed with woe,<br />
This young man got an iron crow;<br />
And, as in tears he did lament,<br />
Unto this little cottage went.</p>
<p class="poetry">When he the door had open got,<br />
This poor, distress&egrave;d, drunken sot,<br />
Who did for store of money hope,<br />
He saw a gibbet and a rope.</p>
<p class="poetry">Under this rope was placed a stool,<br />
Which made him look just like a fool;<br />
Crying, &lsquo;Alas! what shall I do?<br />
Destruction now appears in view!</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;As my father foresaw this thing,<br />
What sottishness to me would bring;<br />
As moneyless, and free of grace,<br />
His legacy I will embrace.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So then, oppressed with discontent,<br />
Upon the stool he sighing went;<br />
And then, his precious life to check,<br />
Did place the rope about his neck.</p>
<p class="poetry">Crying, &lsquo;Thou, God, who sitt&rsquo;st on
high,<br />
And on my sorrow casts an eye;<br />
Thou knowest that I&rsquo;ve not done well,&mdash;<br />
Preserve my precious soul from hell.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis true the slighting of thy
grace,<br />
Has brought me to this wretched case;<br />
And as through folly I&rsquo;m undone,<br />
I&rsquo;ll now eclipse my morning sun.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">When he with sighs these words had spoke,<br />
Jumped off, and down the gibbet broke;<br />
<a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>In
falling, as it plain appears,<br />
Dropped down about this young man&rsquo;s ears,</p>
<p class="poetry">In shining gold, a thousand pound!<br />
Which made the blood his ears surround:<br />
Though in amaze, he cried, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure<br />
This golden salve the sore will cure!</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Blessed be my father, then,&rsquo; he
cried,<br />
&lsquo;Who did this part for me so hide;<br />
And while I do alive remain,<br />
I never will get drunk again.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PART III.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, by the third part you will hear,<br />
This young man, as it doth appear,<br />
With care he then secured his chink,<br />
And to the vintner&rsquo;s went to drink.</p>
<p class="poetry">When the proud vintner did him see,<br />
He frowned on him immediately,<br />
And said, &lsquo;Begone! or else with speed,<br />
I&rsquo;ll kick thee out of doors, indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Smiling, the young man he did say,<br />
&lsquo;Thou cruel knave! tell me, I pray,<br />
As I have here consumed my store,<br />
How durst thee kick me out of door?</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;To me thou hast been too severe;<br />
The deeds of eightscore pounds a-year,<br />
I pawned them for three hundred pounds,<br />
That I spent here;&mdash;what makes such frowns?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The vintner said unto him, &lsquo;Sirrah!<br />
Bring me one hundred pounds to-morrow<br />
By nine o&rsquo;clock,&mdash;take them again;<br />
So get you out of doors till then.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">He answered, &lsquo;If this chink I bring,<br
/>
I fear thou wilt do no such thing.<br />
He said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give under my hand,<br />
A note, that I to this will stand.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>Having the note, away he goes,<br />
And straightway went to one of those<br />
That made him drink when moneyless,<br />
And did the truth to him confess.</p>
<p class="poetry">They both went to this heap of gold,<br />
And in a bag he fairly told<br />
A thousand pounds, ill yellow-boys,<br />
And to the tavern went their ways.</p>
<p class="poetry">This bag they on the table set,<br />
Making the vintner for to fret;<br />
He said, &lsquo;Young man! this will not do,<br />
For I was but in jest with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So then bespoke the young man&rsquo;s
friend:<br />
&lsquo;Vintner! thou mayest sure depend,<br />
In law this note it will you cast,<br />
And he must have his land at last.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">This made the vintner to comply,&mdash;<br />
He fetched the deeds immediately;<br />
He had one hundred pounds, and then<br />
The young man got his deeds again.</p>
<p class="poetry">At length the vintner &rsquo;gan to think<br />
How he was fooled out of his chink;<br />
Said, &lsquo;When &rsquo;tis found how I came off,<br />
My neighbours will me game and scoff.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So to prevent their noise and clatter<br />
The vintner he, to mend the matter,<br />
In two days after, it doth appear,<br />
Did cut his throat from ear to ear.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus he untimely left the world,<br />
That to this young man proved a churl.<br />
Now he who followed drunkenness,<br />
Lives sober, and doth lands possess.</p>
<p class="poetry">Instead of wasting of his store,<br />
As formerly, resolves no more<br />
To act the same, but does indeed<br />
Relieve all those that are in need.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>Let all young men now, for my sake,<br />
Take care how they such havoc make;<br />

<h3>THE BOWES TRAGEDY.</h3>
<p>Being a true relation of the Lives and Characters of <span
class="smcap">Roger Wrightson</span> and <span
class="smcap">Martha Railton</span>, of the Town of Bowes, in the
County of York, who died for love of each other, in March,
1714/5</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Tune of <i>Queen Dido</i>.</p>
<p>[<i>The Bowes Tragedy</i> is the original of Mallet&rsquo;s
<i>Edition and Emma</i>.&nbsp; In these verses are preserved the
village record of the incident which suggested that poem.&nbsp;
When Mallet published his ballad he subjoined an attestation of
the facts, which may be found in Evans&rsquo; <i>Old Ballads</i>,
vol. ii. p. 237.&nbsp; Edit. 1784.&nbsp; Mallet alludes to the
statement in the parish registry of Bowes, that &lsquo;they both
died of love, and were buried in the same grave,&rsquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; The following is an exact copy of the entry, as
transcribed by Mr. Denham, 17th April, 1847.&nbsp; The words
which we have printed in brackets are found interlined in another
and a later hand by some person who had inspected the
register:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Ro<i>d</i>ger Wrightson, Jun., and Martha
Railton, both of Bowes, Buried in one grave: He <i>D</i>ied in a
Fever, and upon tolling his passing Bell, she cry&rsquo;d out My
heart is broke, and in a <i>F</i>ew hours expir&rsquo;d, purely
[<i>or supposed</i>] thro&rsquo; Love, March 15, 1714/5, aged
about 20 years each.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Denham says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<i>The Bowes Tragedy</i> was, I understand,
written immediately after the death of the lovers, by the then
master of Bowes Grammar School.&nbsp; His name I never
heard.&nbsp; My father, who died a few years ago (aged nearly
80), knew a younger sister of Martha Railton&rsquo;s, who used to
sing it to strangers passing through Bowes.&nbsp; She was a poor
woman, advanced in years, and it brought her in many a piece of
money.&rsquo;]</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; The subject of our mournful song;<br />
Nor such old tales which, heretofore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did so amuse the teeming throng;<br />
Since the sad story which I&rsquo;ll tell,<br />
All other tragedies excel.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>Remote in Yorkshire, near to Bowes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of late did Roger Wrightson dwell;<br />
He courted Martha Railton, whose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Repute for virtue did excel;<br />
Yet Roger&rsquo;s friends would not agree,<br />
That he to her should married be.</p>
<p class="poetry">Their love continued one whole year,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full sore against their parents&rsquo; will;<br />
And when he found them so severe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His loyal heart began to chill:<br />
And last Shrove Tuesday, took his bed,<br />
With grief and woe encompass&egrave;d.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus he continued twelve days&rsquo; space,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In anguish and in grief of mind;<br />
And no sweet peace in any case,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This ardent lover&rsquo;s heart could find;<br />
But languished in a train of grief,<br />
Which pierced his heart beyond relief.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now anxious Martha sore distressed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A private message did him send,<br />
Lamenting that she could not rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till she had seen her loving friend:<br />
His answer was, &lsquo;Nay, nay, my dear,<br />
Our folks will angry be I fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Full fraught with grief, she took no rest,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But spent her time in pain and fear,<br />
Till a few days before his death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She sent an orange to her dear;<br />
But&rsquo;s cruel mother in disdain,<br />
Did send the orange back again.</p>
<p class="poetry">Three days before her lover died,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Martha with a bleeding heart,<br />
To see her dying lover hied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In hopes to ease him of his smart;<br />
Where she&rsquo;s conducted to the bed,<br />
In which this faithful young man laid.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>Where she with doleful cries beheld,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fainting lover in despair;<br />
At which her heart with sorrow filled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Small was the comfort she had there;<br />
Though&rsquo;s mother showed her great respect,<br />
His sister did her much reject.</p>
<p class="poetry">She stayed two hours with her dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In hopes for to declare her mind;<br />
But Hannah Wrightson <a name="citation108a"></a><a
href="#footnote108a" class="citation">[108a]</a> stood so
near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No time to do it she could find:<br />
So that being almost dead with grief,<br />
Away she went without relief.</p>
<p class="poetry">Tears from her eyes did flow amain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she full oft would sighing say,<br />
&lsquo;My constant love, alas! is slain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to pale death, become a prey:<br />
Oh, Hannah, Hannah thou art base;<br />
Thy pride will turn to foul disgrace!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">She spent her time in godly prayers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And quiet rest did from her fly;<br />
She to her friends full oft declares,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She could not live if he did die:<br />
Thus she continued till the bell,<br />
Began to sound his fatal knell.</p>
<p class="poetry">And when she heard the dismal sound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her godly book she cast away,<br />
With bitter cries would pierce the ground.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fainting heart &rsquo;gan to decay:<br />
She to her pensive mother said,<br />
&lsquo;I cannot live now he is dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then after three short minutes&rsquo; space,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As she in sorrow groaning lay,<br />
A gentleman <a name="citation108b"></a><a href="#footnote108b"
class="citation">[108b]</a> did her embrace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And mildly unto her did say,<br />
<a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>&lsquo;Dear melting soul be not so sad,<br />
But let your passion be allayed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Her answer was, &lsquo;My heart is burst,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My span of life is near an end;<br />
My love from me by death is forced,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My grief no soul can comprehend.&rsquo;<br />
Then her poor heart it wax&egrave;d faint,<br />
When she had ended her complaint.</p>
<p class="poetry">For three hours&rsquo; space, as in a
trance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This broken-hearted creature lay,<br />
Her mother wailing her mischance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To pacify her did essay:<br />
But all in vain, for strength being past,<br />
She seemingly did breathe her last.</p>
<p class="poetry">Her mother, thinking she was dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Began to shriek and cry amain;<br />
And heavy lamentations made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which called her spirit back again;<br />
To be an object of hard fate,<br />
And give to grief a longer date.</p>
<p class="poetry">Distorted with convulsions, she,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In dreadful manner gasping lay,<br />
Of twelve long hours no moment free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her bitter groans did her dismay:<br />
Then her poor heart being sadly broke,<br />
Submitted to the fatal stroke.</p>
<p class="poetry">When things were to this issue brought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Both in one grave were to be laid:<br />
But flinty-hearted Hannah thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By stubborn means for to persuade,<br />
Their friends and neighbours from the same,<br />
For which she surely was to blame.</p>
<p class="poetry">And being asked the reason why,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such base objections she did make,<br />
She answer&egrave;d thus scornfully,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In words not fit for Billingsgate:<br />
<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>&lsquo;She might have taken fairer on&mdash;<br />
Or else be hanged:&rsquo; Oh heart of stone!</p>
<p class="poetry">What hell-born fury had possessed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy vile inhuman spirit thus?<br />
What swelling rage was in thy breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That could occasion this disgust,<br />
And make thee show such spleen and rage,<br />
Which life can&rsquo;t cure nor death assuage?</p>
<p class="poetry">Sure some of Satan&rsquo;s minor imps,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordain&egrave;d were to be thy guide;<br />
To act the part of sordid pimps,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fill thy heart with haughty pride;<br />
But take this caveat once for all,<br />
Such devilish pride must have a fall.</p>
<p class="poetry">But when to church the corpse was brought,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And both of them met at the gate;<br />
What mournful tears by friends were shed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When that alas it was too late,&mdash;<br />
When they in silent grave were laid,<br />
Instead of pleasing marriage-bed.</p>
<p class="poetry">You parents all both far and near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By this sad story warning take;<br />
Nor to your children be severe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When they their choice in love do make;<br />
Let not the love of curs&egrave;d gold,<br />
True lovers from their love withhold.</p>

Her uncle left her, I declare,<br />
A sumptuous large possession;<br />
Her father he was to take care<br />
Of her at his discretion.</p>
<p class="poetry">She had ten thousand pounds a-year,<br />
And gold and silver ready,<br />
And courted was by many a peer,<br />
Yet none could gain this lady.<br />
At length a squire&rsquo;s youngest son<br />
In private came a-wooing,<br />
And when he had her favour won,<br />
He feared his utter ruin.</p>
<p class="poetry">The youthful lady straightway cried,<br />
&lsquo;I must confess I love thee,<br />

The very next day after;<br />
But did not let the lawyer know<br />
The lady was his daughter.<br />
Now when the lawyer saw the gold<br />
That he should be she gainer,<br />
A pleasant trick to him he told<br />
With safety to obtain her.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Let her provide a horse,&rsquo; he
cried,<br />

Then with you to some parson ride<br />
Before her parents find her:<br />

And if you any trouble feel,<br />
In court I will stand by thee.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;I give you thanks,&rsquo; the young man cried,<br />

They home returned, and on their knees<br />
They asked their father&rsquo;s blessing,</p>

For child I have no other.</p>

From royal loins descended;<br />

<h3>THE DEATH OF QUEEN JANE.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">(TRADITIONAL.)</span></p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">We</span> have seen an old printed copy
of this ballad, which was written probably about the date of the
event it records, 1537.&nbsp; Our version was taken down from the
singing of a young gipsy girl, to whom it had descended orally
through two generations.&nbsp; She could not recollect the whole
of it.&nbsp; In Miss Strickland&rsquo;s <i>Lives of the Queens of
England</i>, we find the following passage: &lsquo;An English
ballad is extant, which, dwelling on the elaborate mourning of
Queen Jane&rsquo;s ladies, informs the world, in a line of pure
bathos,</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">In black were her
ladies, and black were their faces.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Strickland does not appear to have seen the ballad to
which she refers; and as we are not aware of the existence of any
other ballad on the subject, we presume that her line of
&lsquo;pure bathos&rsquo; is merely a corruption of one of the
ensuing verses.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span><span class="smcap">Queen Jane</span> was in travail<br

For six weeks or more,<br />
Till the women grew tired,<br />
And fain would give o&rsquo;er.<br />
&lsquo;O women!&nbsp; O women!<br />
Good wives if ye be,<br />
Go, send for King Henrie,<br />
And bring him to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">King Henrie was sent for,<br />
He came with all speed,<br />
In a gownd of green velvet<br />
From heel to the head.<br />
&lsquo;King Henrie!&nbsp; King Henrie!<br />
If kind Henrie you be,<br />
Send for a surgeon,<br />
And bring him to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The surgeon was sent for,<br />
He came with all speed,<br />
In a gownd of black velvet<br />
From heel to the head.<br />
He gave her rich caudle,<br />
But the death-sleep slept she.<br />
Then her right side was opened,<br />
And the babe was set free.</p>
<p class="poetry">The babe it was christened,<br />
And put out and nursed,<br />
While the royal Queen Jane<br />
She lay cold in the dust.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>

Six dukes followed after,<br />

CATSKIN.</span></p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> following version of this
ancient English ballad has been collated with three copies.&nbsp;
In some editions it is called <i>Catskin&rsquo;s Garland</i>;
<i>or</i>, <i>the Wandering Young Gentlewoman</i>.&nbsp; The
story has a close similarity to that of <i>Cinderella</i>, and is
supposed to be of oriental origin.&nbsp; Several versions of it
are current in Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Poland, and
Wales.&nbsp; For some account of it see <i>Pictorial Book of
Ballads</i>, ii. 153, edited by Mr. J. S. Moore.]</p>

mothers, and children also,<br />
Draw near unto me, and soon you shall know<br />
The sense of my ditty, and I dare to say,<br />
The like&rsquo;s not been heard of this many a day.</p>
<p class="poetry">The subject which to you I am to relate,<br />
It is of a young squire of vast estate;<br />
The first dear infant his wife did him bear,<br />
It was a young daughter of beauty most rare.</p>
<p class="poetry">He said to his wife, &lsquo;Had this child been
a boy,<br />
&lsquo;Twould have pleased me better, and increased my joy,<br />
If the next be the same sort, I declare,<br />
Of what I&rsquo;m possess&egrave;d it shall have no
share.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>In twelve months&rsquo; time after, this woman, we
hear,<br />
Had another daughter of beauty most clear;<br />
And when that he knew it was but a female,<br />
Into a bitter passion he presently fell,</p>
<p class="poetry">Saying, &lsquo;Since this is of the same sort
as the first,<br />
In my habitation she shall not be nursed;<br />
Pray let her be sent into the countrie,<br />
For where I am, truly, this child shall not be.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">With tears his dear wife unto him did say,<br
/>
&lsquo;Husband, be contented, I&rsquo;ll send her away.&rsquo;<br
/>
Then to the countrie with speed her did send,<br />
For to be brought up by one was her friend.</p>
<p class="poetry">Although that her father he hated her so,<br />
He a good education on her did bestow;<br />
And with a gold locket, and robes of the best,<br />
This slighted young damsel was commonly dressed.</p>
<p class="poetry">And when unto stature this damsel was grown,<br
/>
And found from her father she had no love shown,<br />
She cried, &lsquo;Before I will lay under his frown,<br />
I&rsquo;m resolv&egrave;d to travel the country
around.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PART II.</p>
<p class="poetry">But now mark, good people, the cream of the
jest,<br />
In what sort of manner this creature was dressed;<br />
With cat-skins she made her a robe, I declare,<br />
The which for her covering she daily did wear.</p>
<p class="poetry">Her own rich attire, and jewels beside,<br />
Then up in a bundle by her they were tied,<br />
And to seek her fortune she wandered away;<br />
And when she had travelled a cold winter&rsquo;s day,</p>
<p class="poetry">In the evening-tide she came to a town,<br />
Where at a knight&rsquo;s door she sat herself down,<br />
For to rest herself, who was tir&egrave;d sore;&mdash;<br />
This noble knight&rsquo;s lady then came to the door.</p>
<p class="poetry">This fair creature seeing in such sort of
dress,<br />
The lady unto her these words did express:<br />
<a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>&lsquo;Whence camest thou, girl, and what wouldst thou
have?&rsquo;<br />
She said, &lsquo;A night&rsquo;s rest in your stable I
crave.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The lady said to her, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll grant
thy desire,<br />
Come into the kitchen, and stand by the fire.&rsquo;<br />
Then she thank&egrave;d the lady, and went in with haste;<br />
And there she was gazed on from highest to least.</p>
<p class="poetry">And, being well warmed, her hunger was
great,<br />
They gave her a plate of good food for to eat,<br />
And then to an outhouse this creature was led,<br />
Where with fresh straw she soon made her a bed.</p>
<p class="poetry">And when in the morning the daylight she
saw,<br />
Her riches and jewels she hid in the straw;<br />
And, being very cold, she then did retire<br />
Into the kitchen, and stood by the fire.</p>
<p class="poetry">The cook said, &lsquo;My lady hath promised
that thee<br />
Shall be as a scullion to wait upon me;<br />
What say&rsquo;st thou girl, art thou willing to bide?&rsquo;<br
/>
&lsquo;With all my heart truly,&rsquo; to him she replied.</p>
<p class="poetry">To work at her needle she could very well,<br
/>
And for raising of paste few could her excel;<br />
She being so handy, the cook&rsquo;s heart did win,<br />
And then she was called by the name of Catskin.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PART III.</p>
<p class="poetry">The lady a son had both comely and tall,<br />
Who oftentimes us&egrave;d to be at a ball<br />
A mile out of town; and one evening-tide,<br />
To dance at this ball away he did ride.</p>
<p class="poetry">Catskin said to his mother, &lsquo;Pray, madam,
let me<br />
Go after your son now, this ball for to see.&rsquo;<br />
With that in a passion this lady she grew,<br />
And struck her with the ladle, and broke it in two.</p>
<p class="poetry">On being thus serv&egrave;d she quick got
away,<br />
And in her rich garments herself did array;<br />
And then to this ball she with speed did retire,<br />
Where she danc&egrave;d so bravely that all did admire.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>The sport being done, the young squire did say,<br />
&lsquo;Young lady, where do you live? tell me, I pray.&rsquo;<br

Her answer was to him, &lsquo;Sir, that I will tell,&mdash;<br />
At the sign of the broken ladle I dwell.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">She being very nimble, got home first,
&rsquo;tis said,<br />
And in her catskin robes she soon was arrayed;<br />
And into the kitchen again she did go,<br />
But where she had been they did none of them know.</p>
<p class="poetry">Next night this young squire, to give him
content,<br />
To dance at this ball again forth he went.<br />
She said, &lsquo;Pray let me go this ball for to view.&rsquo;<br
/>
Then she struck with the skimmer, and broke it in two.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then out of the doors she ran full of
heaviness,<br />
And in her rich garments herself soon did dress;<br />
And to this ball ran away with all speed,<br />
Where to see her dancing all wondered indeed.</p>
<p class="poetry">The ball being ended, the young squire said,<br
/>
&lsquo;Where is it you live?&rsquo;&nbsp; She again
answer&egrave;d,<br />
&lsquo;Sir, because you ask me, account I will give,<br />
At the sign of the broken skimmer I live.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Being dark when she left him, she homeward did
hie,<br />
And in her catskin robes she was dressed presently,<br />
And into the kitchen amongst them she went,<br />
But where she had been they were all innocent.</p>
<p class="poetry">When the squire dame home, and found Catskin
there,<br />
He was in amaze and began for to swear;<br />
&lsquo;For two nights at the ball has been a lady,<br />
The sweetest of beauties that ever I did see.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;She was the best dancer in all the whole
place,<br />
And very much like our Catskin in the face;<br />
Had she not been dressed in that costly degree,<br />
I should have swore it was Catskin&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p class="poetry">Next night to the ball he did go once more,<br
/>
And she ask&egrave;d his mother to go as before,<br />
Who, having a basin of water in hand,<br />
She threw it at Catskin, as I understand.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>Shaking her wet ears, out of doors she did run,<br />
And dress&egrave;d herself when this thing she had done.<br />
To the ball once more she then went her ways;<br />
To see her fine dancing they all gave her praise.</p>
<p class="poetry">And having concluded, the young squire said
he,<br />
&lsquo;From whence might you come, pray, lady, tell me?&rsquo;<br
/>
Her answer was, &lsquo;Sir, you shall soon know the same,<br />
From the sign of the basin of water I came.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then homeward she hurried, as fast as could
be;<br />
This young squire then was resolv&egrave;d to see<br />
Whereto she belonged, and, following Catskin,<br />
Into an old straw house he saw her creep in.</p>
<p class="poetry">He said, &lsquo;O brave Catskin, I find it is
thee,<br />
Who these three nights together has so charm&egrave;d me;<br />
Thou&rsquo;rt the sweetest of creatures my eyes e&rsquo;er
beheld,<br />
With joy and content my heart now is filled.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Thou art our cook&rsquo;s scullion, but
as I have life,<br />
Grant me but thy love, and I&rsquo;ll make thee my wife,<br />

&lsquo;Sir, that cannot be, I&rsquo;ve no portion at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Thy beauty&rsquo;s a portion, my joy and
my dear,<br />
I prize it far better than thousands a year,<br />

I&rsquo;ll go to my bed, and feign myself sick.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;There no one shall tend me but thee I
profess;<br />
So one day or another in thy richest dress,<br />
Thou shalt be clad, and if my parents come nigh,<br />
I&rsquo;ll tell them &rsquo;tis for thee that sick I do

<p style="text-align: center">PART IV.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus having consulted, this couple parted.<br
/>
Next day this young squire he took to his bed;<br />
And when his dear parents this thing both perceived,<br />
For fear of his death they were right sorely grieved.</p>
<p class="poetry">To tend him they send for a nurse speedily,<br
/>
He said, &lsquo;None but Catskin my nurse now shall be.&rsquo;<br

<a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>His
parents said, &lsquo;No, son.&rsquo;&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;But
she shall,<br />
Or else I&rsquo;ll have none for to nurse me at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">His parents both wondered to hear him say
thus,<br />
That no one but Catskin must be his nurse;<br />
So then his dear parents their son to content,<br />
Up into his chamber poor Catskin they sent.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sweet cordials and other rich things were
prepared,<br />
Which between this young couple were equally shared;<br />
And when all alone they in each other&rsquo;s arms,<br />
Enjoyed one another in love&rsquo;s pleasant charms.</p>
<p class="poetry">And at length on a time poor Catskin,
&rsquo;tis said,<br />
In her rich attire again was arrayed,<br />
And when that his mother to the chamber drew near,<br />
Then much like a goddess did Catskin appear;</p>
<p class="poetry">Which caused her to stare, and thus for to
say,<br />
&lsquo;What young lady is this, come tell me, I pray?&rsquo;<br
/>
He said, &lsquo;It is Catskin for whom sick I lie,<br />
And except I do have her with speed I shall die.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">His mother then hastened to call up the
knight,<br />
Who ran up to see this amazing great sight;<br />
He said, &lsquo;Is this Catskin we held in such scorn?<br />
I ne&rsquo;er saw a finer dame since I was born.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The old knight he said to her, &lsquo;I prithee
tell me,<br />
From whence thou didst come and of what family?&rsquo;<br />
Then who were her parents she gave them to know,<br />
And what was the cause of her wandering so.</p>
<p class="poetry">The young squire he cried, &lsquo;If you will
save my life,<br />
Pray grant this young creature she may be my wife.&rsquo;<br />
His father replied, &lsquo;Thy life for to save,<br />
If you have agreed, my consent you may have.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Next day, with great triumph and joy as we
hear,<br />
There were many coaches came far and near;<br />
Then much like a goddess dressed in rich array,<br />
Catskin was married to the squire that day.</p>
<p class="poetry">For several days this wedding did last,<br />
Where was many a topping and gallant repast,<br />
<a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>And for
joy the bells rung out all over the town,<br />
And bottles of canary rolled merrily round.</p>
<p class="poetry">When Catskin was married, her fame for to
raise,<br />
Who saw her modest carriage they all gave her praise;<br />
Thus her charming beauty the squire did win;<br />
And who lives so great now as he and Catskin.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PART V.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now in the fifth part I&rsquo;ll endeavour to
show,<br />
How things with her parents and sister did go;<br />
Her mother and sister of life are bereft,<br />
And now all alone the old squire is left.</p>
<p class="poetry">Who hearing his daughter was married so
brave,<br />
He said, &lsquo;In my noddle a fancy I have;<br />
Dressed like a poor man now a journey I&rsquo;ll make,<br />
And see if she on me some pity will take.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then dressed like a beggar he went to her
gate,<br />
Where stood his daughter, who looked very great;<br />
He cried, &lsquo;Noble lady, a poor man I be,<br />
And am now forced to crave charity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">With a blush she asked him from whence that he
came;<br />
And with that he told her, and likewise his name.<br />
She cried &lsquo;I&rsquo;m your daughter, whom you slighted
so,<br />
Yet, nevertheless, to you kindness I&rsquo;ll show.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Through mercy the Lord hath provided for
me;<br />
Pray, father, come in and sit down then,&rsquo; said she.<br />
Then the best provisions the house could afford,<br />
For to make him welcome was set on the board.</p>
<p class="poetry">She said, &lsquo;You are welcome, feed hearty,
I pray,<br />
And, if you are willing, with me you shall stay,<br />
So long as you live.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he made this reply:<br />
&lsquo;I only am come now thy love for to try.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Through mercy, my dear child, I&rsquo;m
rich and not poor,<br />
I have gold and silver enough now in store;<br />
And for this love which at thy hands I have found,<br />
For thy portion I&rsquo;ll give thee ten thousand

<h3>THE JOVIAL HUNTER OF BROMSGROVE;</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">OR, THE OLD
MAN AND HIS THREE SONS.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">(TRADITIONAL.)</span></p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> following ballad has long been
popular in Worcestershire and some of the adjoining
counties.&nbsp; It was printed for the first time by Mr. Allies
of Worcester, under the title of <i>The Jovial Hunter of
Bromsgrove</i>; but amongst the peasantry of that county, and the
adjoining county of Warwick, it has always been called <i>The Old
Man and his Three Sons</i>&mdash;the name given to a fragment of
the ballad still used as a nursery song in the north of England,
the chorus of which slightly varies from that of the
ballad.&nbsp; See post, p. 250.&nbsp; The title of <i>The Old Man
and his Three Sons</i> is derived from the usage of calling a
ballad after the first line&mdash;a practice that has descended
to the present day.&nbsp; In Shakspeare&rsquo;s comedy of <i>As
You Like It</i> there appears to be an allusion to this
ballad.&nbsp; Le Beau says,&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">There comes an old man and his three sons,</p>
<p>to which Celia replies,</p>
<p class="poetry">I could match this beginning with an old
tale.&mdash;i. 2.</p>
<p>Whether <i>The Jovial Hunter</i> belongs to either
Worcestershire or Warwickshire is rather questionable.&nbsp; The
probability is that it is a north country ballad connected with
the family of Bolton, of Bolton, in Wensleydale.&nbsp; A tomb,
said to be that of Sir Ryalas Bolton, the <i>Jovial Hunter</i>,
is shown in Bromsgrove church, Worcestershire; <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>but there
is no evidence beyond tradition to connect it with the name or
deeds of any &lsquo;Bolton;&rsquo; indeed it is well known that
the tomb belongs to a family of another name.&nbsp; In the
following version are preserved some of the peculiarities of the
Worcestershire dialect.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Old</span> Sir Robert
Bolton had three sons,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter;<br />
And one of them was Sir Ryalas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he was a jovial hunter.</p>
<p class="poetry">He ranged all round down by the wood side,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter,<br />
Till in a tree-top a gay lady he spied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he was a jovial hunter.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Oh, what dost thee mean, fair
lady,&rsquo; said he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter;<br />
&lsquo;The wild boar&rsquo;s killed my lord, and has thirty men
gored,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou beest a jovial hunter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Oh, what shall I do this wild boar for
to see?&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter;<br />
&lsquo;Oh, thee blow a blast and he&rsquo;ll come unto thee,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As thou beest a jovial hunter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then he blowed a blast, full north, east, west,
and south,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter;<br />
And the wild boar then heard him full in his den,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As he was a jovial hunter.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then he made the best of his speed unto him,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter;<br />
[Swift flew the boar, with his tusks smeared with [gore], <a
name="citation125a"></a><a href="#footnote125a"
class="citation">[125a]</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Sir Ryalas, the jovial hunter.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then the wild boar, being so stout and so
strong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter;<br />
Thrashed down the trees as he ramped him along,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Sir Ryalas, the jovial hunter.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Oh, what dost thee want of me?&rsquo;
wild boar, said he, <a name="citation125b"></a><a
href="#footnote125b" class="citation">[125b]</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter;<br />
<a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>&lsquo;Oh, I think in my heart I can do enough for
thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For I am the jovial hunter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then they fought four hours in a long summer
day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter;<br />
Till the wild boar fain would have got him away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Sir Ryalas, the jovial hunter.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Sir Ryalas drawed his broad sword with
might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter;<br />
And he fairly cut the boar&rsquo;s head off quite,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he was a jovial hunter.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then out of the wood the wild woman flew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter;<br />
&lsquo;Oh, my pretty spotted pig thou hast slew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For thou beest a jovial hunter.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;There are three things, I demand them of
thee,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter;<br />
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s thy horn, and thy hound, and thy gay lady,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As thou beest a jovial hunter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;If these three things thou dost ask of
me,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter;<br />
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s just as my sword and thy neck can agree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For I am a jovial hunter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then into his long locks the wild woman
flew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter;<br />
Till she thought in her heart to tear him through,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though he was a jovial hunter.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Sir Ryalas drawed his broad sword
again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter,<br />
And he fairly split her head into twain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he was a jovial hunter.</p>
<p class="poetry">In Bromsgrove church, the knight he doth
lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well thy horn, good hunter;<br />
And the wild boar&rsquo;s head is pictured thereby,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Ryalas, the jovial hunter.</p>

<h3>THE FELON SEWE OF ROKEBY AND THE FREERES OF RICHMOND.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> very curious ballad, or, more
properly, metrical romance, was originally published by the late
Doctor Whitaker in his <i>History of Craven</i>, from an ancient
MS., which was supposed to be unique.&nbsp; Whitaker&rsquo;s
version was transferred to Evan&rsquo;s <i>Old </i><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span><i>Ballads</i>, the editor of which work introduced
some judicious conjectural emendations.&nbsp; In reference to
this republication, Dr. Whitaker inserted the following note in
the second edition of his <i>History</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">This tale, saith my MS., was known of old to a
few families only, and by them held so precious, that it was
never intrusted to the memory of the son till the father was on
his death-bed.&nbsp; But times are altered, for since the first
edition of this work, a certain bookseller [the late Mr. Evans]
has printed it verbatim, with little acknowledgment to the first
editor.&nbsp; He might have recollected that <i>The Felon
Sewe</i> had been already reclaimed <i>property vested</i>.&nbsp;
However, as he is an ingenious and deserving man, this hint shall
suffice.&mdash;<i>History of Craven</i>, second edition, London,
1812.</p>
<p>When Sir Walter Scott published his poem of Rokeby, Doctor
Whitaker discovered that <i>The Felon Sewe</i> was not of such
&lsquo;exceeding rarity&rsquo; as he had been led to suppose; for
he was then made acquainted with the fact that another MS. of the
&lsquo;unique&rsquo; ballad was preserved in the archives of the
Rokeby family.&nbsp; This version was published by Scott, who
considered it superior to that printed by Whitaker; and it must
undoubtedly be admitted to be more complete, and, in general,
more correct.&nbsp; It has also the advantage of being
authenticated by the traditions of an ardent family; while of Dr.
Whitaker&rsquo;s version we know nothing more than that it was
&lsquo;printed from a MS. in his possession.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
readings of the Rokeby MS., however, are not always to be
preferred; and in order to produce as full and accurate a version
as the materials would yield, the following text has been founded
upon a careful collation of both MSS.&nbsp; A few alterations
have been adopted, but only when the necessity for them appeared
to be self-evident; and the orthography has been rendered
tolerably uniform, for there is no good reason why we should have
&lsquo;sewe,&rsquo; &lsquo;scho,&rsquo; and &lsquo;sike,&rsquo;
in some places, and the more modern forms of &lsquo;sow,&rsquo;
&lsquo;she,&rsquo; and &lsquo;such,&rsquo; in others.&nbsp; If
the MSS. were correctly transcribed, which we have no ground for
doubting, they must both be referred to a much later period than
the era when the author flourished.&nbsp; The language of the
poem is that of Craven, in Yorkshire; and, although the
composition is acknowledged on all hands to be one of the reign
of Henry VII., the provincialisms of that most interesting
mountain district have been so little affected by the spread of
education, that the <i>Felon Sewe</i> is at the present day
perfectly comprehensible to any Craven peasant, and to such a
reader neither note nor glossary is necessary.&nbsp; Dr.
Whitaker&rsquo;s explanations are, therefore, few and brief, for
he was thoroughly acquainted with the language and the
district.&nbsp; Scott, on the contrary, who knew nothing of the
<a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>dialect,
and confounded its pure Saxon with his Lowland Scotch, gives
numerous notes, which only display his want of the requisite
local knowledge, and are, consequently, calculated to
mislead.</p>
<p>The <i>Felon Sewe</i> belongs to the same class of
compositions as the <i>Hunting of the Hare</i>, reprinted by
Weber, and the <i>Tournament of Tottenham</i>, in Percy&rsquo;s
<i>Reliques</i>.&nbsp; Scott says that &lsquo;the comic romance
was a sort of parody upon the usual subjects of minstrel
poetry.&rsquo;&nbsp; This idea may be extended, for the old comic
romances were in many instances not merely &lsquo;sorts of
parodies,&rsquo; but real parodies on compositions which were
popular in their day, although they have not descended to
us.&nbsp; We certainly remember to have met with an old chivalric
romance, in which the leading incidents were similar to those of
the <i>Felon Sewe</i>.</p>
<p>It may be observed, also, in reference to this poem, that the
design is twofold, the ridicule being equally aimed at the
minstrels and the clergy.&nbsp; The author was in all probability
a follower of Wickliffe.&nbsp; There are many sly satirical
allusions to the Romish faith and practices, in which no orthodox
Catholic would have ventured to indulge.</p>
<p>Ralph Rokeby, who gave the sow to the Franciscan Friars of
Richmond, is believed to have been the Ralph who lived in the
reign of Henry VII.&nbsp; Tradition represents the Baron as
having been &lsquo;a fellow of infinite jest,&rsquo; and the very
man to bestow so valuable a gift on the convent!&nbsp; The
Mistress Rokeby of the ballad was, according to the pedigree of
the family, a daughter and heiress of Danby, of Yafforth.&nbsp;
Friar Theobald cannot be traced, and therefore we may suppose
that the monk had some other name; the minstrel author, albeit a
Wickliffite, not thinking it quite prudent, perhaps, to introduce
a priest <i>in propri&acirc; person&acirc;</i>.&nbsp; The story
is told with spirit, and the verse is graceful and flowing.]</p>

138</span>Songs.</h2>
<h3>ARTHUR O&rsquo;BRADLEY&rsquo;S WEDDING.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">In</span> the ballad called <i>Robin
Hood</i>, <i>his Birth</i>, <i>Breeding</i>, <i>Valour and
Marriage</i>, occurs the following line:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">And some singing
Arthur-a-Bradley.</p>
<p>Antiquaries are by no means agreed as to what is the song of
<i>Arthur-a-Bradley</i>, there alluded to, for it so happens that
there are no less than three different songs about this same
Arthur-a-Bradley.&nbsp; Ritson gives one of them in his <i>Robin
Hood</i>, commencing thus:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">See you not Pierce
the piper.</p>
<p>He took it from a black-letter copy in a private collection,
compared with, and very much corrected by, a copy contained in
<i>An Antidote against Melancholy</i>, <i>made up in pills
compounded of witty Ballads</i>, <i>jovial Songs</i>, <i>and
merry Catches</i>, 1661.&nbsp; Ritson quotes another, and
apparently much more modern song on the same subject, and to the
same tune, beginning,&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">All in the merry
month of May.</p>
<p>It is a miserable composition, as may be seen by referring to
a copy preserved in the third volume of the Roxburgh
Ballads.&nbsp; There is another song, the one given by us, which
appears to be as ancient as any of those of which Arthur
O&rsquo;Bradley is the hero, and from its subject being a
wedding, as also from its being the only Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley
song that we have been enabled to trace in broadside and
chap-books of the last century, we are induced to believe that it
may be the song mentioned in the old ballad, which is supposed to
have been written in the reign of Charles I.&nbsp; An obscure
music publisher, who about thirty years ago resided in the
Metropolis, brought out an edition of <i>Arthur
O&rsquo;Bradley&rsquo;s Wedding</i>, with the prefix
&lsquo;Written by Mr. Taylor.&rsquo;&nbsp; This Mr. Taylor was,
however, only a low comedian of the day, and the ascribed
authorship was a mere trick on the publisher&rsquo;s part to
increase the sale of the song.&nbsp; We are not able to give any
account of the hero, but from his being alluded to by so <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>many of our
old writers, he was, perhaps, not altogether a fictitious
personage.&nbsp; Ben Jonson names him in one of his plays, and he
is also mentioned in Dekker&rsquo;s <i>Honest Whore</i>.&nbsp; Of
one of the tunes mentioned in the song, viz., <i>Hence</i>,
<i>Melancholy</i>! we can give no account; the
other,&mdash;<i>Mad Moll</i>, may be found in Playford&rsquo;s
<i>Dancing-Master</i>, 1698: it is the same tune as the one known
by the names of <i>Yellow Stockings</i> and the <i>Virgin
Queen</i>, the latter title seeming to connect it with Queen
Elizabeth, as the name of Mad Moll does with the history of Mary,
who was subject to mental aberration.&nbsp; The words of <i>Mad
Moll</i> are not known to exist, but probably consisted of some
fulsome panegyric on the virgin queen, at the expense of her
unpopular sister.&nbsp; From the mention of <i>Hence</i>,
<i>Melancholy</i>, and <i>Mad Moll</i>, it is presumed that they
were both popular favourites when <i>Arthur
O&rsquo;Bradley&rsquo;s Wedding</i> was written.&nbsp; A good
deal of vulgar grossness has been at different times introduced
into this song, which seems in this respect to be as elastic as
the French chanson, <i>Cadet Rouselle</i>, which is always being
altered, and of which there are no two copies alike.&nbsp; The
tune of <i>Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley</i> is given by Mr. Chappell in
his <i>Popular Music</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Come</span>, neighbours,
and listen awhile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If ever you wished to smile,<br />
Or hear a true story of old,<br />
Attend to what I now unfold!<br />
&rsquo;Tis of a lad whose fame did resound<br />
Through every village and town around,<br />
For fun, for frolic, and for whim,<br />
None ever was to equal him,<br />
And his name was Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O! rare Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley! wonderful Arthur
O&rsquo;Bradley!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley, O!</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, Arthur being stout and bold,<br />
And near upon thirty years old,<br />
He needs a wooing would go,<br />
To get him a helpmate, you know.<br />
So, gaining young Dolly&rsquo;s consent,<br />
Next to be married they went;<br />
And to make himself noble appear,<br />
He mounted the old padded mare;<br />
<a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>He chose
her because she was blood,<br />
And the prime of his old daddy&rsquo;s stud.<br />
She was wind-galled, spavined, and blind,<br />
And had lost a near leg behind;<br />
She was cropped, and docked, and fired,<br />
And seldom, if ever, was tired,<br />
She had such an abundance of bone;<br />
So he called her his high-bred roan,<br />
A credit to Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O! rare Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley! wonderful Arthur
O&rsquo;Bradley!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley, O!</p>
<p class="poetry">Then he packed up his drudgery hose,<br />
And put on his holiday clothes;<br />
His coat was of scarlet so fine,<br />
Full trimmed with buttons behind;<br />
Two sleeves it had it is true,<br />
One yellow, the other was blue,<br />
And the cuffs and the capes were of green,<br />
And the longest that ever were seen;<br />
His hat, though greasy and tore,<br />
Cocked up with a feather before,<br />
And under his chin it was tied,<br />
With a strip from an old cow&rsquo;s hide;<br />
His breeches three times had been turned,<br />
And two holes through the left side were burned;<br />
Two boots he had, but not kin,<br />
One leather, the other was tin;<br />
And for stirrups he had two patten rings,<br />
Tied fast to the girth with two strings;<br />
Yet he wanted a good saddle cloth,<br />
Which long had been eat by the moth.<br />
&rsquo;Twas a sad misfortune, you&rsquo;ll say,<br />
But still he looked gallant and gay,<br />
And his name it was Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O! rare Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley! wonderful Arthur
O&rsquo;Bradley!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley, O!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>Thus accoutred, away he did ride,<br />
While Dolly she walked by his side;<br />
Till coming up to the church door,<br />
In the midst of five thousand or more,<br />
Then from the old mare he did alight,<br />
Which put the clerk in a fright;<br />
And the parson so fumbled and shook,<br />
That presently down dropped his book.<br />
Then Arthur began for to sing,<br />
And made the whole church to ring;<br />
Crying, &lsquo;Dolly, my dear, come hither,<br />
And let us be tacked together;<br />
For the honour of Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley!&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O! rare Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley! wonderful Arthur
O&rsquo;Bradley!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley, O!</p>
<p class="poetry">Then the vicar discharged his duty,<br />
Without either reward or fee,<br />
Declaring no money he&rsquo;d have;<br />
And poor Arthur he&rsquo;d none to give:<br />
So, to make him a little amends,<br />
He invited him home with his friends,<br />
To have a sweet kiss at the bride,<br />
And eat a good dinner beside.<br />
The dishes, though few, were good,<br />
And the sweetest of animal food:<br />
First, a roast guinea-pig and a bantam,<br />
A sheep&rsquo;s head stewed in a lanthorn, <a
name="citation141"></a><a href="#footnote141"
class="citation">[141]</a><br />
Two calves&rsquo; feet, and a bull&rsquo;s trotter,<br />
The fore and hind leg of an otter,<br />
With craw-fish, cockles, and crabs,<br />
Lump-fish, limpets, and dabs,<br />
Red herrings and sprats, by dozens,<br />
To feast all their uncles and cousins;<br />
<a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>Who
seemed well pleased with their treat,<br />
And heartily they did all eat,<br />
For the honour of Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O! rare Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley! wonderful Arthur
O&rsquo;Bradley!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley, O!</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, the guests being well satisfied,<br />
The fragments were laid on one side,<br />
When Arthur, to make their hearts merry,<br />
Brought ale, and parkin, <a name="citation142"></a><a
href="#footnote142" class="citation">[142]</a> and perry;<br />
When Timothy Twig stept in,<br />
With his pipe, and a pipkin of gin.<br />
A lad that was pleasant and jolly,<br />
And scorned to meet melancholy;<br />
He would chant and pipe so well,<br />
No youth could him excel.<br />
Not Pan the god of the swains,<br />
Could ever produce such strains;<br />
But Arthur, being first in the throng,<br />
He swore he would sing the first song,<br />
And one that was pleasant and jolly:<br />
And that should be &lsquo;Hence, Melancholy!&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Now give me a dance,&rsquo; quoth Doll,<br />
&lsquo;Come, Jeffrery, play up Mad Moll,<br />
&rsquo;Tis time to be merry and frisky,&mdash;<br />
But first I must have some more whiskey.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Oh! you&rsquo;re right,&rsquo; says Arthur, &lsquo;my
love!<br />
My daffy-down-dilly! my dove!<br />
My everything! my wife!<br />
I ne&rsquo;er was so pleased in my life,<br />
Since my name it was Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley!&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O! rare Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley! wonderful Arthur
O&rsquo;Bradley!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley, O!</p>
<p class="poetry">Then the piper he screwed up his bags,<br />
And the girls began shaking their rags;<br />
<a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>First up
jumped old Mother Crewe,<br />
Two stockings, and never a shoe.<br />
Her nose was crook&egrave;d and long,<br />
Which she could easily reach with her tongue;<br />
And a hump on her back she did not lack,<br />
But you should take no notice of that;<br />
And her mouth stood all awry,<br />
And she never was heard to lie,<br />
For she had been dumb from her birth;<br />
So she nodded consent to the mirth,<br />
For honour of Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O! rare Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley! wonderful Arthur
O&rsquo;Bradley!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley, O!</p>
<p class="poetry">Then the parson led off at the top,<br />
Some danced, while others did hop;<br />
While some ran foul of the wall,<br />
And others down backwards did fall.<br />
There was lead up and down, figure in,<br />
Four hands across, then back again.<br />
So in dancing they spent the whole night,<br />
Till bright Phoebus appeared in their sight;<br />
When each had a kiss of the bride,<br />
And hopped home to his own fire-side:<br />
Well pleased was Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O! rare Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley! wonderful Arthur
O&rsquo;Bradley!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet Arthur O&rsquo;Bradley, O!</p>

<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Hold! ploughman,&rsquo; said the
gardener, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t count your trade with ours,<br />
Walk through the garden, and view the early flowers;<br />
Also the curious border and pleasant walks go view,&mdash;<br />
There&rsquo;s none such peace and plenty perform&egrave;d by the
plough!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Hold! gardener,&rsquo; said the
ploughman, &lsquo;my calling don&rsquo;t despise,<br />
Each man for his living upon his trade relies;<br />
Were it not for the ploughman, both rich and poor would rue,<br
/>
For we are all dependent upon the painful plough.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Adam in the garden was sent to keep it
right,<br />
But the length of time he stayed there, I believe it was one
night;<br />
Yet of his own labour, I call it not his due,<br />
Soon he lost his garden, and went to hold the plough.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;For Adam was a ploughman when ploughing
first begun,<br />
The next that did succeed him was Cain, the eldest son;<br />
Some of the generation this calling now pursue;<br />
That bread may not be wanting, remains the painful plough.</p>
<p class="poetry">Samson was the strongest man, and Solomon was
wise,<br />
Alexander for to conquer &rsquo;twas all his daily prise;<br />
King David was valiant, and many thousands slew,<br />
Yet none of these brave heroes could live without the plough!</p>
<p class="poetry">Behold the wealthy merchant, that trades in
foreign seas,<br />
And brings home gold and treasure for those who live at ease;<br
/>
With fine silks and spices, and fruits also, too,<br />
They are brought from the Indies by virtue of the plough.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>&lsquo;For they must have bread, biscuit, rice pudding,
flour and peas,<br />
To feed the jolly sailors as they sail o&rsquo;er the seas;<br />
And the man that brings them will own to what is true,<br />
He cannot sail the ocean without the painful plough!</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I hope there&rsquo;s none offended at me
for singing this,<br />
For it is not intended for anything amiss.<br />
If you consider rightly, you&rsquo;ll find what I say is true,<br
/>
For all that you can mention depends upon the plough.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>THE USEFUL PLOW;</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">OR, THE
PLOUGH&rsquo;S PRAISE.</span></p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> common editions of this
popular song inform us that it is taken &lsquo;from an Old
Ballad,&rsquo; alluding probably to the dialogue given at page
44.&nbsp; This song is quoted by Farquhar.]</p>
<p class="poetry">A <span class="smcap">country</span> life is
sweet!<br />
In moderate cold and heat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To walk in the air, how pleasant and fair!<br />
In every field of wheat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fairest of flowers adorning the bowers,<br />
And every meadow&rsquo;s brow;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To that I say, no courtier may<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Compare with they who clothe in grey,<br />
And follow the useful plow.</p>
<p class="poetry">They rise with the morning lark,<br />
And labour till almost dark;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then folding their sheep, they hasten to sleep;<br
/>
While every pleasant park<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Next morning is ringing with birds that are
singing,<br />
On each green, tender bough.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With what content, and merriment,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their days are spent, whose minds are bent<br />
To follow the useful plow.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>The gallant that dresses fine,<br />
And drinks his bottles of wine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were he to be tried, his feathers of pride,<br />
Which deck and adorn his back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are tailors&rsquo; and mercers&rsquo;, and other men
dressers,<br />
For which they do dun them now.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But Ralph and Will no compters fill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For tailor&rsquo;s bill, or garments still,<br />
But follow the useful plow.</p>
<p class="poetry">Their hundreds, without remorse,<br />
Some spend to keep dogs and horse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who never would give, as long as they live,<br />
Not two-pence to help the poor;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their wives are neglected, and harlots respected;<br
/>
This grieves the nation now;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis not so with us that go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where pleasures flow, to reap and mow,<br />
And follow the useful plow.</p>
<h3>THE FARMER&rsquo;S SON.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> song, familiar to the
dwellers in the dales of Yorkshire, was published in 1729, in the
<i>Vocal Miscellany</i>; <i>a collection of about four hundred
celebrated songs</i>.&nbsp; As the <i>Miscellany</i> was merely
an anthology of songs already well known, the date of this song
must have been sometime anterior to 1729.&nbsp; It was
republished in the <i>British Musical Miscellany</i>, <i>or the
Delightful Grove</i>, 1796, and in a few other old song
books.&nbsp; It was evidently founded on an old black-letter
dialogue preserved in the Roxburgh collection, called <i>A Mad
Kinde of Wooing</i>; <i>or</i>, <i>a Dialogue between Will the
Simple and Nan the Subtill</i>, <i>with their loving
argument</i>.&nbsp; To the tune of the New Dance at the Red Bull
Playhouse.&nbsp; Printed by the assignees of Thomas Symcock.]</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; I solemnly swear and vow,<br />
No lords in their lives take pleasure in wives,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like fellows that drive the plough:<br />
For whatever they gain with labour and pain,<br />

A London beau that could outdo<br />

<h3>THE FARMER&rsquo;S BOY.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Mr. Denham</span> of Piersbridge, who
communicates the following, says&mdash;&lsquo;there is no
question that the <i>Farmer&rsquo;s Boy</i> is a very ancient
song; it is highly popular amongst the north country lads and
lasses.&rsquo;&nbsp; The date of the composition may probably be
referred to the commencement of the last century, when there
prevailed amongst the ballad-mongers a great rage for
<i>Farmers&rsquo; Sons</i>, <i>Plough Boys</i>, <i>Milk
Maids</i>, <i>Farmers&rsquo; Boys</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; The
song is popular all over the country, and there are numerous
printed copies, ancient and modern.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> sun had set
behind yon hills,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across yon dreary moor,<br />
Weary and lame, a boy there came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to a farmer&rsquo;s door:<br />
&lsquo;Can you tell me if any there be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That will give me employ,<br />
To plow and sow, and reap and mow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And be a farmer&rsquo;s boy?</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;My father is dead, and mother is left<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With five children, great and small;<br />
And what is worse for mother still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the oldest of them all.<br />
<a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>Though
little, I&rsquo;ll work as hard as a Turk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ll give me employ,<br />

<p class="poetry">&lsquo;And if that you won&rsquo;t me
employ,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One favour I&rsquo;ve to ask,&mdash;<br />
Will you shelter me, till break of day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From this cold winter&rsquo;s blast?<br />
At break of day, I&rsquo;ll trudge away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Elsewhere to seek employ,<br />
To plow and sow, and reap and mow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And be a farmer&rsquo;s boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Come, try the lad,&rsquo; the mistress
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Let him no further seek.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;O, do, dear father!&rsquo; the daughter cried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While tears ran down her cheek:<br />
&lsquo;He&rsquo;d work if he could, so &rsquo;tis hard to want
food,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wander for employ;<br />
Don&rsquo;t turn him away, but let him stay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And be a farmer&rsquo;s boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And when the lad became a man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The good old farmer died,<br />
And left the lad the farm he had,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his daughter for his bride.<br />
The lad that was, the farm now has,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oft smiles, and thinks with joy<br />
Of the lucky day he came that way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be a farmer&rsquo;s boy.</p>

He looks to the harvest, that gives us the mow.</p>
<h3>THE BARLEY-MOW SONG.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> song is sung at country
meetings in Devon and Cornwall, particularly on completing the
carrying of the barley, when the rick, or mow of barley, is
finished.&nbsp; On putting up the last sheaf, which is called the
craw (or crow) sheaf, the man who has it cries out &lsquo;I have
it, I have it, I have it;&rsquo; another demands, &lsquo;What
have &rsquo;ee, what have &rsquo;ee, what have &rsquo;ee?&rsquo;
and the answer is, &lsquo;A craw! a craw! a craw!&rsquo; upon
which there is some cheering, &amp;c., and a supper
afterwards.&nbsp; The effect of the <i>Barley-mow Song</i> cannot
be given in words; it should be heard, to be appreciated
properly,&mdash;particularly with the West-country dialect.]</p>

<h3>THE CRAVEN CHURN-SUPPER SONG.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">In</span> some of the more remote dales
of Craven it is customary at the close of the hay-harvest for the
farmers to give an entertainment to their men; this is called the
churn supper; a name which Eugene Aram traces to &lsquo;the
immemorial usage of producing at such suppers a great quantity of
cream in a churn, and circulating it in cups to each of the
rustic company, to be eaten with bread.&rsquo;&nbsp; At these
churn-suppers the masters and their families attend the
entertainment, and share in the general mirth.&nbsp; The men mask
themselves, and dress in a grotesque manner, and are allowed the
privilege of playing harmless practical jokes on their employers,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The churn-supper song varies in different dales,
but the following used to be the most popular version.&nbsp; In
the third verse there seems to be an allusion to the
clergyman&rsquo;s taking tythe in kind, on which occasions he is
generally accompanied by two or three men, and the parish
clerk.&nbsp; The song has never before been printed.&nbsp; There
is a marked resemblance between it and a song of the date of
1650, called <i>A Cup of Old Stingo</i>.&nbsp; See <i>Popular
Music of the Olden Time</i>, I., 308.]</p>

<h3>THE RURAL DANCE ABOUT THE MAY-POLE.</h3>

80.&nbsp; It is there called <i>The Rural Dance about the

Young&rsquo;s ball</i>, <i>May</i>, 1671.&nbsp; The tune is in
<i>Popular Music</i>.&nbsp; The <i>May-pole</i>, for so the song
is called in modern collections, is a very popular ditty at the
present time.&nbsp; The common copies vary considerably from the
following version, which is much more correct than any hitherto

<h3>THE HELSTONE FURRY-DAY SONG.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">At</span> Helstone, in Cornwall, the 8th
of May is a day devoted to revelry and gaiety.&nbsp; It is called
the Furry-day, supposed to be a corruption of Flora&rsquo;s day,
from the garlands worn and carried in procession during the
festival. <a name="citation167"></a><a href="#footnote167"
class="citation">[167]</a>&nbsp; A writer in the
<i>Gentleman&rsquo;s </i><a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span><i>Magazine</i> for June, 1790,
says, &lsquo;In the morning, very early, some troublesome rogues
go round the streets [of Helstone], with drums and other noisy
instruments, disturbing their sober neighbours, and singing parts
of a song, the whole of which nobody now re-collects, and of
which I know no more than that there is mention in it of the
&lsquo;grey goose quill,&rsquo; and of going &lsquo;to the green
wood&rsquo; to bring home &lsquo;the Summer and the May,
O!&rsquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; During the festival, the gentry,
tradespeople, servants, &amp;c., dance through the streets, and
thread through certain of the houses to a very old dance tune,
given in the appendix to Davies Gilbert&rsquo;s <i>Christmas
Carols</i>, and which may also be found in Chappell&rsquo;s
<i>Popular Music</i>, and other collections.&nbsp; The
<i>Furry-day Song</i> possesses no literary merit whatever; but
as a part of an old and really interesting festival, it is worthy
of preservation.&nbsp; The dance-tune has been confounded with
that of the song, but Mr. Sandys, to whom we are indebted for
this communication, observes that &lsquo;the dance-tune is quite
different.&rsquo;]</p>

<h3>CORNISH MIDSUMMER BONFIRE SONG.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> very ancient custom of
lighting fires on Midsummer-eve, being the vigil of St. John the
Baptist, is still kept up in several parts of Cornwall.&nbsp; On
these occasions the fishermen and others dance about the fires,
and sing appropriate songs.&nbsp; The following has been sung for
a long series of years at Penzance and the neighbourhood, and is
taken down from the recitation of the leader of a West-country
choir.&nbsp; It is communicated to our pages by Mr. Sandys.&nbsp;
The origin of the Midsummer bonfires is fully explained in
Brand&rsquo;s <i>Popular Antiquities</i>.&nbsp; See Sir H.
Ellis&rsquo;s edition of that work, vol. i. pp.
166&ndash;186.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> bonny month of
June is crowned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the sweet scarlet rose;<br />
The groves and meadows all around<br />

<p class="poetry">As I walked out to yonder green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening so fair;<br />
All where the fair maids may be seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Playing at the bonfire.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hail! lovely nymphs, be not too coy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But freely yield your charms;<br />
Let love inspire with mirth and joy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Cupid&rsquo;s lovely arms.</p>
<p class="poetry">Bright Luna spreads its light around,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gallants for to cheer;<br />
As they lay sporting on the ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the fair June bonfire.</p>
<p class="poetry">All on the pleasant dewy mead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They shared each other&rsquo;s charms;<br />
Till Phoebus&rsquo; beams began to spread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And coming day alarms.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">In</span> no part of England are the

<h3>THE HAYMAKER&rsquo;S SONG.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">An</span> old and very favourite ditty
sung in many parts of England at merry-makings, especially at
those which occur during the hay-harvest.&nbsp; It is not in any
collection.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> the merry month
of June,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the prime time of the year;<br />
Down in yonder meadows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There runs a river clear:<br />
And many a little fish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth in that river play;<br />
And many a lad, and many a lass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go abroad a-making hay.</p>
<p class="poetry">In come the jolly mowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To mow the meadows down;<br />
With budget and with bottle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of ale, both stout and brown,<br />
All labouring men of courage bold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come here their strength to try;<br />
They sweat and blow, and cut and mow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the grass cuts very dry.</p>
<p class="poetry">Here&rsquo;s nimble Ben and Tom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With pitchfork, and with rake;<br />
Here&rsquo;s Molly, Liz, and Susan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come here their hay to make.<br />

sweet, jug, jug, jug!<br />

From morning unto even-song,<br />

<p class="poetry">And when that bright day faded,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the sun was going down,<br />
There was a merry piper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Approach&egrave;d from the town:<br />
He pulled out his pipe and tabor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So sweetly he did play,<br />
Which made all lay down their rakes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And leave off making hay.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then joining in a dance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They jig it o&rsquo;er the green;<br />
Though tired with their labour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No one less was seen.<br />
But sporting like some fairies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their dance they did pursue,<br />
In leading up, and casting off,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till morning was in view.</p>
<p class="poetry">And when that bright daylight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning it was come,<br />
They lay down and rested<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the rising of the sun:<br />
Till the rising of the sun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the merry larks do sing,<br />
And each lad did rise and take his lass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And away to hay-making.</p>
<h3>THE SWORD-DANCERS&rsquo; SONG.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Sword-dancing</span> is not so common in
the North of England as it was a few years ago; but a troop of
rustic practitioners of the art may still be occasionally met
with at Christmas time, in some of the most secluded of the
Yorkshire dales.&nbsp; The following is <a

the introductory song, as it used to be sung by the Wharfdale
sword-dancers.&nbsp; It has been transcribed from a MS. in the
possession of Mr. Holmes, surgeon, at Grassington, in
Craven.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the song a dance ensues, and
sometimes a rustic drama is performed.&nbsp; See post, p.
175.&nbsp; <i>Jumping Joan</i>, alluded to in the last verse, is
a well-known old country dance tune.]</p>
<p><i>The spectators being assembled</i>, <i>the</i> <span

circle with his sword</i>, <i>walks round it</i>, <i>and calls in

I think he is as smart a youth<br />

In courting of the ladies gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He fixes his delight;<br />
He will not stay from them all day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And is with them all the night.</p>
<p class="poetry">The next&rsquo;s a tailor by his trade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Called Obadiah Trim;<br />

That he is of the Quaking sect,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who would seem to act by merit<br />
Of yeas and nays, and hums and hahs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And motions of the spirit.</p>
<p class="poetry">The next that enters on the floor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He is a foppish knight;<br />
The first to be in modish dress,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He studies day and night.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Even from top to toe;<br />

SWORD-DANCERS&rsquo; SONG AND INTERLUDE.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">AS NOW
PERFORMED AT CHRISTMAS, IN THE COUNTY OF DURHAM.</span></p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> late Sir Cuthbert Sharp
remarks, that &lsquo;It is still the practice during the
Christmas holidays for companies of fifteen to perform a sort of
play or dance, accompanied by song or music.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
following version of the song, or interlude, has been transcribed
from Sir C. Sharp&rsquo;s <i>Bishoprick Garland</i>, corrected by
collation with a MS. copy recently remitted to the editor by a
countryman of Durham.&nbsp; The Devonshire peasants have a
version almost identical with this, but laths are used instead of
swords, and a few different characters are introduced to suit the
locality.&nbsp; The pageant called <i>The Fool Plough</i>, which
consists of a number of sword-dancers dragging a plough with
music, was anciently observed in the North of England, not only
at Christmas time, but also in the beginning of Lent.&nbsp;
Wallis thinks that the <i>Sword Dance</i> is the antic dance, or
chorus armatus of the Romans.&nbsp; Brand supposes that it is a
composition made up of the gleaning of several obsolete customs
anciently followed in England and other countries.&nbsp; The
Germans still practise the <i>Sword Dance</i> at Christmas and
Easter.&nbsp; We once witnessed a <i>Sword Dance</i> in the Eifel
mountains, which closely resembled our own, but no interlude, or
drama, was performed.]</p>

<h3>THE MASKERS&rsquo; SONG.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">In</span> the Yorkshire dales the young
men are in the habit of going about at Christmas time in
grotesque masks, and of performing in the farm-houses a sort of
rude drama, accompanied by singing and music. <a
name="citation180"></a><a href="#footnote180"
class="citation">[180]</a>&nbsp; The maskers have wooden swords,
and the performance is an evening one.&nbsp; The following
version of their introductory song was taken down literally from
the recitation of a young besom-maker, now residing at Linton in
Craven, who <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>for some years past has himself been one of these
rustic actors.&nbsp; From the allusion to the pace, or
paschal-egg, it is evident that the play was originally an Easter
pageant, which, in consequence of the decline of the gorgeous
rites formerly connected with that season, has been transferred
to Christmas, the only festival which, in the rural districts of
Protestant England, is observed after the olden fashion.&nbsp;
The maskers generally consist of five characters, one of whom
officiates in the threefold capacity of clown, fiddler, and
master of the ceremonies.&nbsp; The custom of masking at
Christmas is common to many parts of Europe, and is observed with
especial zest in the Swiss cantons, where the maskers are all
children, and the performances closely resemble those of
England.&nbsp; In Switzerland, however, more care is bestowed
upon the costume, and the songs are better sung.]</p>

parts of England to hand round the wassail, or health-bowl, on
New-Year&rsquo;s Eve.&nbsp; The custom is supposed to be of Saxon
origin, and to be derived from one of the observances of the
Feast of Yule.&nbsp; The tune of this song is given in <i>Popular
Music</i>.&nbsp; It is a universal favourite in Gloucestershire,
particularly in the neighbourhood of</p>

<h3>FRAGMENT OF THE HAGMENA SONG.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">As sung at Richmond, Yorkshire, on
the eve of the New Year, by the Corporation Pinder.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> custom of singing Hagmena
songs is observed in different parts of both England and
Scotland.&nbsp; The origin of the term is a matter of
dispute.&nbsp; Some derive it from &lsquo;au guy l&rsquo;an
neuf,&rsquo; i.e., <i>to the misletoe this new year</i>, and a
French Hagmena song still in use seems to give some authority to
such a derivation; others, dissatisfied with a heathen source,
find the term to be a corruption of [Greek text which cannot be
reproduced], i.e., <i>the holy month</i>.&nbsp; The Hagmena songs
are sometimes sung on Christmas Eve and a few of the preceding
nights, and sometimes, as at Richmond, on the eve of the new
year.&nbsp; For further information the reader is referred to
Brand&rsquo;s <i>Popular Antiquities</i>, vol. i. 247&ndash;8,

<h3>THE GREENSIDE WAKES SONG.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> wakes, feasts, or tides of the
North of England, were originally religious festivals in honour
of the saints to whom the parish churches were dedicated.&nbsp;
But now-a-days, even in Catholic Lancashire, all traces of their
pristine character have departed, and the hymns and prayers by
which their observance was once hallowed have given place to
dancing and merry-making.&nbsp; At Greenside, near Manchester,
during the wakes, two persons, dressed in a grotesque manner, the
one a male, the other a female, appear in the village on
horseback, with spinning-wheels before them; and the following is
the dialogue, or song, which they sing on these occasions.]</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&rsquo;<span class="smcap">Tis</span>
Greenside wakes, we&rsquo;ve come to the town<br />
To show you some sport of great renown;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Tread the wheel, tread the wheel, den, don, dell
O.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Thou&rsquo;rt a saucy old jade, and pray
hold thy tongue,<br />
Or I shall be thumping thee ere it be long;<br />
And if that I do, I shall make thee to rue,<br />
For I can have many a one as good as you.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tread the wheel, tread the wheel, dan, don, dell

We&rsquo;ll do our endeavour to please them next year.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tread the wheel, tread the wheel, dan, don, dell

<h3>THE SWEARING-IN SONG OR RHYME.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">As formerly sung or said at
Highgate, in the county of Middlesex.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> proverb, &lsquo;He has been
sworn at Highgate,&rsquo; is more widely circulated than
understood.&nbsp; In its ordinary signification it is applied to
a &lsquo;knowing&rsquo; fellow who is well acquainted with the
&lsquo;good things,&rsquo; and always helps himself to the best;
and it has its origin in an old usage still kept up at Highgate,
in Middlesex.&nbsp; Grose, in his <i>Classical Dictionary of the
Vulgar Tongue</i>, London, 1785, says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A ridiculous custom formerly prevailed at the
public-houses of Highgate, to administer a ludicrous oath to all
the men of the middling rank who stopped there.&nbsp; The party
was sworn on a pair of horns fastened on a stick; the substance
of the oath was never to kiss the maid when he could kiss the
mistress, never to drink small beer when he could get strong,
with many other injunctions of the like kind to all of which was
added a saving clause&mdash;<i>Unless you like it best</i>!&nbsp;
The person administering the oath was always to be called father
by the juror, and he in return was to style him son, under the
penalty of a bottle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this extract it is evident that in 1786 the custom was
ancient, and had somewhat fallen into desuetude.&nbsp;
Hone&rsquo;s <i>Year-Book</i> contains a very complete account of
the ceremony, with full particulars of the mode in which the
&lsquo;swearing-in&rsquo; was then performed in the &lsquo;Fox
under the Hill.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hone does not throw any light on the
origin of the practice, nor does he seem to have been aware of
its comparative antiquity.&nbsp; He treated the ceremony as a
piece of modern foolery, got up by some landlord for &lsquo;the
good of the house,&rsquo; and adopted from the same interested
motive by others of the tribe.&nbsp; A subsequent correspondent
of Mr. Hone, however, points out the antiquity of the custom, and
shows that it could <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>be traced back long before the year
1782, when it was introduced into a pantomime called <i>Harlequin
Teague</i>; <i>or</i>, <i>the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway</i>, which
was performed at the Haymarket on Saturday, August 17,
1782.&nbsp; One of the scenes was Highgate, where, in the
&lsquo;parlour&rsquo; of a public house, the ceremony was
performed.&nbsp; Mr. Hone&rsquo;s correspondent sends a copy of
the old initiation song, which varies considerably from our
version, supplied to us in 1851 by a very old man (an ostler) at
Highgate.&nbsp; The reciter said that the <i>copy of verses</i>
was not often used now, as there was no landlord who could sing,
and gentlemen preferred the speech.&nbsp; He said, moreover,
&lsquo;that the verses were not always alike&mdash;some said one
way, and some another&mdash;some made them long, and some <i>cut
&rsquo;em short</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Grose was in error when he supposed that the ceremony was
confined to the inferior classes, for even in his day such was
not the case.&nbsp; In subsequent times the oath has been
frequently taken by people of rank, and also by several persons
of the highest literary and political celebrity.&nbsp; An
inspection of any one of the register-books will show that the
jurors have belonged to all sorts of classes, and that amongst
them the Harrovians have always made a conspicuous figure.&nbsp;
When the stage-coaches ceased to pass through the village in
consequence of the opening of railways, the custom declined, and
was kept up only at three houses, which were called the
&lsquo;original house,&rsquo; the &lsquo;old original,&rsquo; and
the &lsquo;real old original.&rsquo;&nbsp; Two of the above
houses have latterly ceased to hold courts, and the custom is now
confined to the &lsquo;Fox under the Hill,&rsquo; where the rite
is celebrated with every attention to ancient forms and costume,
and for a fee which, in deference to modern notions of economy,
is only one shilling.</p>
<p>Byron, in the first canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>, alludes to
the custom of Highgate:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some o&rsquo;er thy Thamis
row the ribboned fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Others along the safer turnpike fly;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Richmond-hill ascend, some wend to Ware,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And many to the steep of Highgate hie.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask ye, B&oelig;otian shades! the reason why?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;<i>Tis to the worship of the solemn
horn</i>,<br />

<p class="poetry">At Tainhall forest, Queen Anne she did ride,<br

A hearty good fellow as ever could be,<br />
His coffin was made of a limb of the tree.</p>
<p class="poetry">With black-strap and perry he made his friends
merry,<br />
All sorrow for to drown with brandy and sherry.<br />
So we&rsquo;ll booze it away, dull care we&rsquo;ll defy,<br />
And be happy on the first Friday in July.</p>
<p class="poetry">At Tainhall forest there stands a tree,<br />
And it has performed a wonderful bounty,<br />
It is surrounded by woods and plains,<br />
The merry little warblers chant their strains.</p>

we will be,<br />
Every year we&rsquo;ll agree the fair for to see;<br />
And we&rsquo;ll booze it away, dull care we&rsquo;ll defy,<br />

but we are strongly inclined to believe that it may be assigned
to the early part of the seventeenth century, and that it relates
to the visit of Prince Charles and Buckingham, under the assumed
names of Jack and Tom, to Spain, in 1623.&nbsp; Some curious
references to the adventures of the Prince and his companion, on
their masquerading tour, will be found in Halliwell&rsquo;s

197</span>JOAN&rsquo;S ALE WAS NEW.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Ours</span> is the common version of this
popular song; it varies considerably from the one given by
D&rsquo;Urfey, in the <i>Pills to purge Melancholy</i>.&nbsp;
From the names of Nolly and Joan and the allusion to ale, we are
inclined to consider the song as a lampoon levelled at Cromwell,
and his wife, whom the Royalist party nick-named
&lsquo;Joan.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Protector&rsquo;s acquaintances
(depicted as low and vulgar tradesmen) are here humorously
represented paying him a congratulatory visit on his change of
fortune, and regaling themselves with the
&lsquo;Brewer&rsquo;s&rsquo; ale.&nbsp; The song is mentioned in
Thackeray&rsquo;s Catalogue, under the title of <i>Joan&rsquo;s
Ale&rsquo;s New</i>; which may be regarded as circumstantial
evidence in favour of our hypothesis.&nbsp; The air is published
in <i>Popular Music</i>, accompanying three stanzas of a version
copied from the Douce collection.&nbsp; The first verse in Mr.
Chappell&rsquo;s book runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> was a jovial
tinker,<br />
Who was a good ale drinker,<br />
He never was a shrinker,<br />
Believe me this is true;<br />

Which made him look like a Jack a-lent.<br />

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> were six
jovial tradesmen,<br />

And he swore he&rsquo;d go and mend a kettle,<br />
Good heart, how his hammer and nails did rattle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Joan&rsquo;s ale was new!</p>

<h3>GEORGE RIDLER&rsquo;S OVEN.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> ancient Gloucestershire song
has been sung at the annual dinners of the Gloucestershire
Society, from the earliest period of the existence of that
institution; and in 1776 there was an Harmonic Society at
Cirencester, which always opened its meetings with <i>George
Ridler&rsquo;s Oven</i> in full chorus.</p>
<p>The substance of the following key to this very curious song
is furnished by Mr. H. Gingell, who extracts it from the
<i>Annual Report of the Gloucestershire Society</i> for
1835.&nbsp; The annual meeting of this Society is held at Bristol
in the month of August, when the members dine, and a branch
meeting, which was formerly held at the Crown and Anchor in the
Strand, is now annually held at the Thatched House Tavern, St.
James&rsquo;s.&nbsp; <i>George Ridler&rsquo;s Oven</i> is sung at
both meetings, and the late Duke of Beaufort used to lead off the
glee in capital style.&nbsp; The words have a secret meaning,
well known to the members of the Gloucestershire Society, which
was founded in 1657, three years before the Restoration of
Charles II.&nbsp; The Society consisted of Royalists, who
combined together for the purpose of restoring the Stuarts.&nbsp;
The Cavalier party was supported by all the old Roman Catholic
families of the kingdom; and some of the Dissenters, who were
disgusted with Cromwell, occasionally lent them a kind of passive
aid.</p>
<p><i>First Verse</i>.&mdash;By &lsquo;George Ridler&rsquo; is
meant King Charles I.&nbsp; The &lsquo;oven&rsquo; was the
Cavalier party.&nbsp; The &lsquo;stwons&rsquo; that &lsquo;built
the oven,&rsquo; and that &lsquo;came out of the Bleakney
quaar,&rsquo; were the immediate followers of the Marquis of
Worcester, who held out long and steadfastly for the Royal cause
at Raglan Castle, which was not surrendered till 1646, and was in
fact the last stronghold retained for the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;His
head did grow above his hair,&rsquo; is an allusion to the crown,
the head of the State, which the King wore &lsquo;above his
hair.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Second Verse</i>.&mdash;This means that the King,
&lsquo;before he died,&rsquo; boasted that notwithstanding his
present adversity, the ancient constitution of the kingdom was so
good, and its vitality so great, that it would surpass and
outlive every other form of government.</p>
<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span><i>Third Verse</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;Dick the treble, Jack
the mean, and George the bass,&rsquo; mean King, Lords, and
Commons.&nbsp; The injunction to &lsquo;let every man sing in his
own place,&rsquo; is a warning to each of the three estates of
the realm to preserve its proper position, and not to encroach on
each other&rsquo;s prerogative.</p>
<p><i>Fourth Verse</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;Mine hostess&rsquo;s
maid&rsquo; is an allusion to the Queen, who was a Roman
Catholic, and her maid, the Church.&nbsp; The singer we must
suppose was one of the leaders of the party, and his
&lsquo;dog&rsquo; a companion, or faithful official of the
Society, and the song was sung on occasions when the members met
together socially; and thus, as the Roman Catholics were
Royalists, the allusion to the mutual attachment between the
&lsquo;maid&rsquo; and &lsquo;my dog and I,&rsquo; is plain and
consistent.</p>
<p><i>Fifth Verse</i>.&mdash;The &lsquo;dog&rsquo; had a
&lsquo;trick of visiting maids when they were sick.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The meaning is, that when any of the members were in distress or
desponding, or likely to give up the Royal cause in despair, the
officials, or active members visited, counselled, and assisted
them.</p>
<p><i>Sixth Verse</i>.&mdash;The &lsquo;dog&rsquo; was
&lsquo;good to catch a hen,&rsquo; a &lsquo;duck,&rsquo; or a
&lsquo;goose.&rsquo;&mdash;That is, to enlist as members of the
Society any who were well affected to the Royal cause.</p>
<p><i>Seventh Verse</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;The good ale tap&rsquo; is
an allusion, under cover of the similarity in sound between the
words ale and aisle, to the Church, of which it was dangerous at
the time to be an avowed follower; and so the members were
cautioned that indiscretion might lead to their discovery and
&lsquo;overthrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Eighth Verse</i>.&mdash;The allusion here is to those
unfaithful supporters of the Royal cause, who
&lsquo;welcomed&rsquo; the members of the Society when it
appeared to be prospering, but &lsquo;parted&rsquo; from them in
adversity.</p>
<p><i>Ninth Verse</i>.&mdash;An expression of the singer&rsquo;s
wish that if he should die he may be buried with his faithful
companion, as representing the principles of the Society, under
the good aisles of the church.</p>
<p>The following text has been collated with a version published
in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, from the &lsquo;fragments of a MS.
found in the speech-house of Dean.&rsquo;&nbsp; The tune is the
same as that of the <i>Wassailers&rsquo; Song</i>, and is printed
in <i>Popular Music</i>.&nbsp; Other ditties appear to have been
founded on this ancient piece.&nbsp; The fourth, seventh, and
ninth verses are in the old ditty called <i>My Dog and I</i>: and
the eighth verse appears in another old song.&nbsp; The air and
words bear some resemblance to <i>Todlen Hame</i>.]</p>

<h3>THE CARRION CROW.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> still popular song is quoted
by Grose in his <i>Olio</i>, where it is made the subject of a
burlesque commentary, the covert political allusions having
evidently escaped the penetration of the antiquary.&nbsp; The
reader familiar with the annals of the Commonwealth and the
Restoration, will readily detect the leading points of the
allegory.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Carrion Crow&rsquo; in the oak is
Charles II., who is represented as that bird of voracious
appetite, because he deprived the puritan clergy of their
livings; perhaps, also, because he ordered the bodies of the
regicides to be exhumed&mdash;as Ainsworth says in one of his
ballads:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> carrion crow is
a sexton bold,<br />
He raketh the dead from out of the mould.</p>
<p>The religion of the &lsquo;old sow,&rsquo; whoever she may be,
is clearly pointed out by her little pigs praying for her
soul.&nbsp; The &lsquo;tailor&rsquo; is not easily
identified.&nbsp; It is possibly intended for some puritan divine
of the name of Taylor, who wrote and preached against both
prelacy and papacy, but with an especial hatred of the
latter.&nbsp; In the last verse he consoles himself by the
reflection that, notwithstanding the deprivations, his party will
have enough remaining from the voluntary contributions of their
adherents.&nbsp; The &lsquo;cloak&rsquo; which the tailor is
engaged in cutting out, is the Genevan gown, or cloak; the
&lsquo;spoon&rsquo; in which he desires his wife to bring
treacle, is apparently an allusion to the &lsquo;spatula&rsquo;
upon which the wafer is placed in the administration of the
Eucharist; and the introduction of &lsquo;chitterlings and
black-puddings&rsquo; into the last verse seems to refer to a
passage in Rabelais, where the same dainties are brought in to
personify those who, in the matter of fasting, are opposed to
Romish practices.&nbsp; The song is found in collections of the
time of Charles II.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> carrion crow he

WHISTLING SONG.</span></p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> is a countryman&rsquo;s

somewhat resembling the hero&rsquo;s in the burlesque version of
<i>Don Giovanni</i>.&nbsp; The tune is <i>Lilli burlero</i>, and
the song is sung as follows:&mdash;the first line of each verse
is given as a solo; then the tune is continued by a chorus of
whistlers, who whistle that portion of the air which in <i>Lilli
burlero</i> would be sung to the words, <i>Lilli burlero bullen a
la</i>.&nbsp; The songster then proceeds with the tune, and <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>sings the
whole of the verse through, after which the strain is resumed and
concluded by the whistlers.&nbsp; The effect, when accompanied by
the strong whistles of a group of lusty countrymen, is very
striking, and cannot be adequately conveyed by description.&nbsp;
This song constitutes the &lsquo;traditionary verses&rsquo; upon
which Burns founded his <i>Carle of Killyburn Braes</i>.]</p>

about,&mdash;<br />
Says one to the other, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s try turn her
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">She spied thirteen imps all dancing in
chains,<br />
She up with her pattens, and beat out their brains.</p>
<p class="poetry">She knocked the old Satan against the
wall,&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s try turn her out, or she&rsquo;ll murder us
all!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Now he&rsquo;s bundled her up on his back
amain,<br />
And to her old husband he took her again.</p>

WICHET AND HIS WIFE.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> song still retains its
popularity in the North of England, and, when sung with humour,
never fails to elicit roars of laughter.&nbsp; A Scotch version
may be found in Herd&rsquo;s Collection, 1769, and also in
Cunningham&rsquo;s <i>Songs of England and Scotland</i>, London,
1835.&nbsp; We cannot venture to give an opinion as to which is
the original; but the English set is of unquestionable
antiquity.&nbsp; Our copy was obtained from Yorkshire.&nbsp; It
has been collated with one printed at the Aldermary press, and
preserved in the third volume of the Roxburgh Collection.&nbsp;
The tune is peculiar to the song.]</p>

<h3>THE JOLLY WAGGONER.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> country song can be traced
back a century at least, but is, no doubt, much older.&nbsp; It
is very popular in the West of England.&nbsp; The words are
spirited and characteristic.&nbsp; We may, perhaps, refer the
song to the days of transition, when the waggon displaced the
packhorse.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">When</span> first I went
a-waggoning, a-waggoning did go,<br />
I filled my parents&rsquo; hearts full of sorrow, grief, and woe.

<h3>THE YORKSHIRE HORSE-DEALER.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> ludicrous and genuine
Yorkshire song, the production of some unknown country minstrel,
obtained considerable popularity a few years ago from the
admirable singing of Emery.&nbsp; The incidents actually occurred
at the close of the last century, and some of the descendants of
&lsquo;Tommy Towers&rsquo; were resident at Clapham till within a
very recent period, and used to take great delight in relating
the laughable adventure of their progenitor.&nbsp; Abey Muggins
is understood to be a <i>sobriquet</i> for a then Clapham
innkeeper.&nbsp; The village of Clapham is in the west of
Yorkshire, on the high road between Skipton and Kendal.]</p>

<h3>THE KING AND THE COUNTRYMAN.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> popular favourite is a mere
abridgment and alteration of a poem preserved in the Roxburgh
Collection, called <i>The King and Northern Man</i>, <i>shewing
how a poor Northumberland man</i> (<i>tenant to the King</i>)
<i>being wronged by a lawyer</i> (<i>his neighbour</i>) <i>went
to the King himself to make known his grievance</i>.&nbsp; <i>To
the tune of </i><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

at the Stationer&rsquo;s Arms in Green Arbour Court, in the
Little Old Baily.&nbsp; The Percy Society printed <i>The King and
Northern Man</i> from an edition published in 1640.&nbsp; There
is also a copy preserved in the Bagford Collection, which is one
of the imprints of W. Onley.&nbsp; The edition of 1640 has the
initials of Martin Parker at the end, but, as Mr. Collier
observes, &lsquo;There is little doubt that the story is much
older than 1640.&rsquo;&nbsp; See preface to Percy
Society&rsquo;s Edition.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> was an old
chap in the west country,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A flaw in the lease the lawyers had found,<br />
&rsquo;Twas all about felling of five oak trees,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And building a house upon his own ground.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right too looral, looral,
looral&mdash;right too looral la!</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, this old chap to Lunnun would go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To tell the king a part of his woe,<br />
Likewise to tell him a part of his grief,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In hopes the king would give him relief.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, when this old chap to Lunnun had come,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; He found the king to Windsor had gone;<br />
But if he&rsquo;d known he&rsquo;d not been at home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He danged his buttons if ever he&rsquo;d come.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, when this old chap to Windsor did
stump,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gates were barred, and all secure,<br />
But he knocked and thumped with his oaken clump,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s room within for I to be sure.</p>
<p class="poetry">But when he got there, how he did stare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see the yeomen strutting about;<br />
He scratched his head, and rubbed down his hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the ear of a noble he gave a great shout:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Pray, Mr. Noble, show I the King;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that the King that I see there?<br />
I seed an old chap at Bartlemy fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look more like a king than that chap there.</p>

Which if you&rsquo;ll be so kind as to do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I gotten a summat for you in my fob.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The king he took the lease in hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To sign it, too, he was likewise willing;<br />
And the old chap to make a little amends,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He lugg&rsquo;d out his bag, and gave him a
shilling.</p>
<p class="poetry">The king, to carry on the joke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordered ten pounds to be paid down;<br />
The farmer he stared, but nothing spoke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stared again, and he scratched his crown.</p>
<p class="poetry">The farmer he stared to see so much money,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; And to take it up he was likewise willing;<br />
But if he&rsquo;d a known King had got so much money,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He danged his wig if he&rsquo;d gien him that

<h3>THORNEHAGH-MOOR WOODS.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">A CELEBRATED
NOTTINGHAMSHIRE POACHER&rsquo;S SONG.</span></p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Nottinghamshire</span> was, in the olden
day, famous in song for the achievements of Robin Hood and his
merry men.&nbsp; In our times the reckless daring of the heroes
of the &lsquo;greenwood tree&rsquo; has descended to the poachers
of the county, who have also found poets to proclaim and exult
over <i>their</i> lawless exploits; and in <i>Thornehagh-Moor
Woods</i> we have a specimen of one of these rude, but
mischievous and exciting lyrics.&nbsp; The air is beautiful, and
of a lively character; and will be found in <i>Popular
Music</i>.&nbsp; There is it prevalent idea that the song is not
the production of an ordinary ballad-writer, but was written
about the middle of the last century by a gentleman of rank and
education, who, detesting the English game-laws, adopted a too
successful mode of inspiring the peasantry with a love of
poaching.&nbsp; The song finds locality in the village of
Thornehagh, in the hundred of Newark.&nbsp; The common, or
Moor-fields, was inclosed about 1797, and is now no longer called
by the ancient designation.&nbsp; It contains eight hundred
acres.&nbsp; The manor of Thornehagh is the property of the
ancient family of Nevile, who have a residence on the
estate.]</p>

<p class="poetry">I went out with my dogs one night,&mdash;<br />
The moon shone clear, and the stars gave light;<br />
Over hedges and ditches, and steyls<br />
With my two dogs close at my heels,<br />
To catch a fine buck in Thornehagh-Moor fields.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh! that night we had bad luck,<br />
One of my very best dogs was stuck;<br />
He came to me both breeding and lame,&mdash;<br />
Right sorry was I to see the same,&mdash;<br />
He was not able to follow the game.</p>
<p class="poetry">I searched his wounds, and found them
slight,<br />
Some keeper has done this out of spite;<br />
But I&rsquo;ll take my pike-staff,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
plan!<br />
I&rsquo;ll range the woods till I find the man,<br />
And I&rsquo;ll tan his hide right well,&mdash;if I can!</p>
<p class="poetry">I ranged the woods and groves all night,<br />
I ranged the woods till it proved daylight;<br />
The very first thing that then I found,<br />
Was a good fat buck that lay dead on the ground;<br />
I knew my dogs gave him his death-wound.</p>
<p class="poetry">I hired a butcher to skin the game,<br />
Likewise another to sell the same;<br />
The very first buck he offered for sale,<br />
Was to an old [hag] that sold bad ale,<br />
And she sent us three poor lads to gaol.</p>
<p class="poetry">The quarter sessions we soon espied,<br />
At which we all were for to be tried;<br />
The Chairman laughed the matter to scorn,<br />

<h3>THE LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> very old ditty has been
transformed into the dialects of Somersetshire, Northamptonshire,
and Leicestershire; but it properly belongs to
Lincolnshire.&nbsp; Nor is this the only liberty that his been
taken with it.&nbsp; The original tune is that of a Lancashire
air, well known as <i>The Manchester Angel</i>; but a florid
modern tune has been substituted.&nbsp; <i>The Lincolnshire
Poacher</i> was a favourite ditty with George IV., and it is said
that he often had it sung for his amusement by a band of
Berkshire ploughmen.&nbsp; He also commanded it to be sung at his
harvest-homes, but we believe it was always on such occasions
sung to the &lsquo;playhouse tune,&rsquo; and not to the genuine
music.&nbsp; It is often very difficult to trace the locality of
countrymen&rsquo;s songs, in consequence of the licence adopted
by printers of changing the names of places to suit their own
neighbourhoods; but there is no such difficulty about <i>The
Lincolnshire Poacher</i>.&nbsp; The oldest copy we have seen,
printed at York about 1776, reads &lsquo;Lincolnshire,&rsquo; and
it is only in very modern copies that the venue is removed to
other counties.&nbsp; In the Somersetshire version the local
vernacular is skilfully substituted for that of the original; but
the deception may, nevertheless, be very easily detected.]</p>

<h3>SOMERSETSHIRE HUNTING SONG.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> following song, which is very
popular with the peasantry of Somersetshire, is given as a
curious specimen of the dialect still spoken in some parts of
that county.&nbsp; Though the song is a genuine peasant&rsquo;s
ditty, it is heard in other circles, and frequently roared out at
hunting dinners.&nbsp; It is here reprinted from a copy
communicated by Mr. Sandys.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There&rsquo;s</span> no

<h3>THE TROTTING HORSE.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> common copies of this old
highwayman&rsquo;s song are very corrupt.&nbsp; We are indebted
for the following version, which contains several emendations, to
Mr. W. H. Ainsworth.&nbsp; The song, which may probably be
referred to the age of Charles II., is a spirited specimen of its
class.]</p>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">can</span> sport as fine
a trotting horse as any swell in town,<br />
To trot you fourteen miles an hour, I&rsquo;ll bet you fifty
crown;<br />
He is such a one to bend his knees, and tuck his haunches in,<br

And throw the dust in people&rsquo;s face, and think it not a
sin.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For to ride
away, trot away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ri, fa lar, la,

<p class="poetry">He has an eye like any hawk, a neck like any

<p class="poetry">If you drop therein, he&rsquo;ll nod his head,
and boldly walk away,<br />
While others kick and bounce about, to him it&rsquo;s only
play;<br />
There never was a finer horse e&rsquo;er went on English
ground,<br />
He is rising six years old, and is all over right and sound.<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For to ride
away, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">If any frisk or milling match should call me
out of town,<br />
I can pass the blades with white cockades, their whiskers hanging

With large jack-towels round their necks, they think

But, with their gapers open wide, they find that they are
last.<br />

<p class="poetry">If threescore miles I am from home, I darkness
never mind,<br />
My friend is gone, and I am left, with pipe and pot behind;<br />
Up comes some saucy kiddy, a scampsman on the hot,<br />
But ere he pulls the trigger I am off just like a shot.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I ride away,

<p class="poetry">If Fortune e&rsquo;er should fickle be, and

Only grant to me what God hath gave, my mistress and my horse!<br

<h3><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>THE
SEEDS OF LOVE.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> very curious old song is not
only a favourite with our peasantry, but, in consequence of
having been introduced into the modern dramatic entertainment of
<i>The Loan of a Lover</i>, has obtained popularity in higher
circles.&nbsp; Its sweetly plaintive tune will be found in
<i>Popular Music</i>.&nbsp; The words are quaint, but by no means
wanting in beauty; they are, no doubt, corrupted, as we have
derived them from common broadsides, the only form in which we
have been able to meet with them.&nbsp; The author of the song
was Mrs. Fleetwood Habergham, of Habergham, in the county of
Lancaster.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ruined by the extravagance, and disgraced
by the vices of her husband, she soothed her sorrows,&rsquo; says
Dr. Whitaker, &lsquo;by some stanzas yet remembered among the old
people of her neighbourhood.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>History of
Whalley</i>.&nbsp; Mrs. Habergham died in 1703, and was buried at
Padiham.]</p>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">sowed</span> the seeds of
love, it was all in the spring,<br />
In April, May, and June, likewise, when small birds they do
sing;<br />
My garden&rsquo;s well planted with flowers everywhere,<br />
Yet I had not the liberty to choose for myself the flower that I
loved so dear.</p>
<p class="poetry">My gardener he stood by, I asked him to choose
for me,<br />
He chose me the violet, the lily and pink, but those I refused
all three;<br />
The violet I forsook, because it fades so soon,<br />
The lily and the pink I did o&rsquo;erlook, and I vowed I&rsquo;d
stay till June.</p>
<p class="poetry">In June there&rsquo;s a red rose-bud, and
that&rsquo;s the flower for me!<br />
But often have I plucked at the red rose-bud till I gained the
willow-tree;<br />
The willow-tree will twist, and the willow-tree will
twice,&mdash;<br />
O! I wish I was in the dear youth&rsquo;s arms that once had the
heart of mine.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

care,<br />
For in the middle of a red rose-bud there grows a sharp thorn

I told him I&rsquo;d take no care till I did feel the smart,<br

And often I plucked at the red rose-bud till I pierced it to the
heart.</p>
<p class="poetry">I&rsquo;ll make me a posy of hyssop,&mdash;no

That all the world may plainly see I love one flower too much;<br

<h3>THE GARDEN-GATE.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">One</span> of our most pleasing rural
ditties.&nbsp; The air is very beautiful.&nbsp; We first heard it
sung in Malhamdale, Yorkshire, by Willy Bolton, an old
Dales&rsquo;-minstrel, who accompanied himself on the
union-pipes. <a name="citation221b"></a><a href="#footnote221b"

shone bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The village clock struck eight;<br />
Young Mary hastened, with delight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto the garden-gate:<br />
But what was there that made her sad?&mdash;<br />
The gate was there, but not the lad,<br />
Which made poor Mary say and sigh,<br />
&lsquo;Was ever poor girl so sad as I?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">She traced the garden here and there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The village clock struck nine;<br />
Which made poor Mary sigh, and say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;You shan&rsquo;t, you shan&rsquo;t be
mine!<br />
You promised to meet at the gate at eight,<br />
You ne&rsquo;er shall keep me, nor make me wait,<br />
For I&rsquo;ll let all such creatures see,<br />
They ne&rsquo;er shall make a fool of me!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">She traced the garden here and there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The village clock struck ten;<br />
Young William caught her in his arms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No more to part again:<br />

And O! he had been a long, long way;&mdash;<br />
<a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>Then,

And all the village joyful were,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon their wedding-day:<br />
Now in a cot, by a river side,<br />
William and Mary both reside;<br />
And she blesses the night that she did wait<br />
For her absent swain, at the garden-gate.</p>
<h3>THE NEW-MOWN HAY.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> song is a village-version of
an incident which occurred in the Cecil family.&nbsp; The same
English adventure has, strangely enough, been made the subject of
one of the most romantic of Moore&rsquo;s <i>Irish Melodies</i>,
viz., <i>You remember Helen</i>, <i>the hamlet&rsquo;s
pride</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">As</span> I walked forth
one summer&rsquo;s morn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard by a river&rsquo;s side,<br />
Where yellow cowslips did adorn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The blushing field with pride;<br />
I spied a damsel on the grass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More blooming than the may;<br />
Her looks the Queen of Love surpassed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the new-mown hay.</p>
<p class="poetry">I said, &lsquo;Good morning, pretty maid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How came you here so soon?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;To keep my father&rsquo;s sheep,&rsquo; she said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;The thing that must be done:<br />
While they are feeding &lsquo;mong the dew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To pass the time away,<br />
I sit me down to knit or sew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the new-mown hay.&rsquo;</p>

With vows of love I did prevail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On her to be my bride:<br />
In strains of simple melody,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She sung a rural lay;<br />
The little lambs stood listening by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the new-mown hay.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then to the church they went with speed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Hymen joined them there;<br />
No more her ewes and lambs to feed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For she&rsquo;s a lady fair:<br />
A lord he was that married her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To town they came straightway:<br />
She may bless the day he spied her there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the new-mown hay.</p>
<h3>THE PRAISE OF A DAIRY.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> excellent old country song,
which can be traced to 1687, is sung to the air of
<i>Packington&rsquo;s Pound</i>, for the history of which see
<i>Popular Music</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> praise of a dairy
I purpose to sing,<br />
But all things in order, first, God save the King! <a

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Queen, I
may say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That every
May-day,<br />
Has many fair dairy-maids all fine and gay.<br />
Assist me, fair damsels, to finish my theme,<br />
Inspiring my fancy with strawberry cream.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>The first of fair dairy-maids, if you&rsquo;ll
believe,<br />
Was Adam&rsquo;s own wife, our great grandmother Eve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who oft milked a
cow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As well she knew
how.<br />
Though butter was not then as cheap as &rsquo;tis now,<br />
She hoarded no butter nor cheese on her shelves,<br />
For butter and cheese in those days made themselves.</p>
<p class="poetry">In that age or time there was no horrid
money,<br />
Yet the children of Israel had both milk and honey;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Queen you
could see,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the highest
degree,<br />
But would milk the brown cow with the meanest she.<br />
Their lambs gave them clothing, their cows gave them meat,<br />
And in plenty and peace all their joys wore complete.</p>
<p class="poetry">Amongst the rare virtues that milk does
produce,<br />
For a thousand of dainties it&rsquo;s daily in use:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now a pudding
I&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;ee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so can maid
Nelly,<br />
Must have from good milk both the cream and the jelly:<br />
For a dainty fine pudding, without cream or milk,<br />
Is a citizen&rsquo;s wife, without satin or silk.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the virtues of milk there is more to be
mustered:<br />
O! the charming delights both of cheesecake and custard!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If to wakes <a

class="citation">[225]</a> you resort,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can have no
sport,<br />
Unless you give custards and cheesecake too for&rsquo;t:<br />
And what&rsquo;s the jack-pudding that makes us to laugh,<br />
Unless he hath got a great custard to quaff?</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>Both pancake and fritter of milk have good store,<br />
But a Devonshire white-pot must needs have much more;<br />

class="citation">[226a]</a> you can think,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though you study
and wink,<br />
From the lusty sack posset to poor posset drink,<br />
But milk&rsquo;s the ingredient, though wine&rsquo;s <a

<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> is a very old ditty, and a

the Percy Society, we have met with a copy printed at

one or two instances they are apparently more ancient, and are,

third and last stanzas.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">It</span> was one
summer&rsquo;s morning, as I went o&rsquo;er the moss,<br />
I had no thought of &rsquo;listing, till the soldiers did me
cross;<br />
They kindly did invite me to a flowing bowl, and down,<br />
<i>They advanc&egrave;d</i> me some money,&mdash;ten guineas and
a crown.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s true my love has listed, he
wears a white cockade,<br />
He is a handsome tall young man, besides a roving blade;<br />
He is a handsome young man, and he&rsquo;s gone to serve the
king,<br />
<i>Oh</i>! <i>my very</i> heart is breaking for the loss of
him.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;My love is tall and handsome, and comely
for to see,<br />
And by a sad misfortune a soldier now is he;<br />
I hope the man that listed him may not prosper night nor day,<br

<i>For I wish that</i> the Holl&agrave;nders may sink him in the
sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Oh! may he never prosper, oh! may he
never thrive,<br />
Nor anything he takes in hand so long as he&rsquo;s alive;<br />
May the very grass he treads upon the ground refuse to grow,<br

<i>Since he&rsquo;s been</i> the only cause of my sorrow, grief,
and woe!&rsquo;</p>

eyes,&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;Leave off those lamentations, likewise those mournful

<i>We&rsquo;ll be married</i> when I return again.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>OLD ADAM.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">We</span> have had considerable trouble
in procuring a copy of this old song, which used, in former days,
to be very popular with aged people resident in the North of
England.&nbsp; It has been long out of print, and handed down
traditionally.&nbsp; By the kindness, however, of Mr. S.
Swindells, printer, Manchester, we have been favoured with an
ancient printed copy, which Mr. Swindells observes he had great
difficulty in obtaining.&nbsp; Some improvements have been made
in the present edition from the recital of Mr. Effingham Wilson,
who was familiar with the song in his youth.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Both</span> sexes give ear
to my fancy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While in praise of dear woman I sing;<br />
Confined not to Moll, Sue, or Nancy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But mates from a beggar to king.</p>
<p class="poetry">When old Adam first was created,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lord of the universe crowned,<br />
His happiness was not completed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Until that an helpmate was found.</p>
<p class="poetry">He&rsquo;d all things in food that were
wanting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep and support him through life;<br />
He&rsquo;d horses and foxes for hunting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which some men love better than wife.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Man cannot produce in his life;<br />
But yet the all-wise great Creator<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still saw that he wanted a wife.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Adam he laid in a slumber,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there he lost part of his side;<br />
And when he awoke, with a wonder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beheld his most beautiful bride!</p>
<p class="poetry">In transport he gaz&egrave;d upon her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His happiness now was complete!<br />
He prais&egrave;d his bountiful donor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who thus had bestowed him a mate.</p>
<p class="poetry">She was not took out of his head, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To reign and triumph over man;<br />
Nor was she took out of his feet, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By man to be trampled upon.</p>
<p class="poetry">But she was took out of his side, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His equal and partner to be;<br />
But as they&rsquo;re united in one, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The man is the top of the tree.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then let not the fair be despis&egrave;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By man, as she&rsquo;s part of himself;<br />
For woman by Adam was priz&egrave;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More than the whole globe full of wealth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Man without a woman&rsquo;s a beggar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose the whole world he possessed;<br />
And the beggar that&rsquo;s got a good woman,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With more than the world he is blest.</p>

Think of this when you smoke tobacco!</p>
<p class="poetry">The dust that from the pipe doth fall,<br />
It shows we are nothing but dust at all;<br />

&lsquo;O, Dolly, my dear, what hast thou done?<br />
From my back to my breeks has thy butter-milk run.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">She gave him a push, he stumbled and fell<br />
Down from the dairy into the drawwell.<br />
Then Harry, the ploughboy, ran amain,<br />

And told his old mother what he had been at.<br />
With butter-milk, bowl, and a terrible fall,<br />

<h3>JOCKEY TO THE FAIR.</h3>
<p>[A <span class="smcap">version</span> of this song, not quite
so accurate as the following was published from an old broadside
in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, vol. vii., p. 49, where it is
described as a &lsquo;very celebrated Gloucestershire
ballad.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Gloucestershire is not exclusively
entitled to the honour of this genuine old country song, which is
well known in Westmoreland and other counties.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Jockey&rsquo; songs constitute a distinct and numerous
class, and belong for the most part to the middle of the last
century, when Jockey and Jenny were formidable rivals to the
Strephons and Chloes of the artificial school of pastoral
poetry.&nbsp; The author of this song, whoever he was, drew upon
real rural life, and not upon its fashionable masquerade.&nbsp;
We have been unable to trace the exact date of this ditty, which
still enjoys in some districts a wide popularity.&nbsp; It is not
to be found in any of several large collections of Ranelagh and
Vauxhall songs, and other anthologies, which we have
examined.&nbsp; From the christian names of the lovers, it might
be supposed to be of Scotch or Border origin; but <i>Jockey to
the Fair</i> is not confined to the North; indeed it is much
better known, and more frequently sung, in the South and
West.]</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;<span class="smcap">Twas</span> on the
morn of sweet May-day,<br />
When nature painted all things gay,<br />
Taught birds to sing, and lambs to play,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And gild the meadows fair;<br />
<a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>Young

Arose and tripped it o&rsquo;er the lawn;<br />

For Jenny had vowed away to run<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Jockey to the fair;<br />
For Jenny had vowed, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">The cheerful parish bells had rung,<br />
With eager steps he trudged along,<br />
While flowery garlands round him hung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which shepherds use to wear;<br />
He tapped the window; &lsquo;Haste, my dear!&rsquo;<br />
Jenny impatient cried, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis I, my love, and no one near;<br />
Step gently down, you&rsquo;ve nought to fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Jockey to the fair.&rsquo;<br
/>
Step gently down, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;My dad and mam are fast asleep,<br />
My brother&rsquo;s up, and with the sheep;<br />
And will you still your promise keep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which I have heard you swear?<br
/>
And will you ever constant prove?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;I will, by all the powers above,<br />
And ne&rsquo;er deceive my charming dove;<br />
Dispel these doubts, and haste, my love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Jockey to the fair.&rsquo;<br

&lsquo;Will Jenny be my charming bride?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Hymen meet us there.&rsquo;<br

Then Jockey did his vows renew;<br />
He would be constant, would he true,<br />
His word was pledged; away she flew,<br />
O&rsquo;er cowslips tipped with balmy dew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Jockey to the fair.<br />

<h3>THE SWEET NIGHTINGALE;</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">OR, DOWN IN
THOSE VALLEYS BELOW.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">AN ANCIENT
CORNISH SONG.</span></p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> curious ditty, which may be
confidently assigned to the seventeenth century, is said to be a
translation from the ancient <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>Cornish tongue.&nbsp; We first heard
it in Germany, in the pleasure-gardens of the Marienberg, on the
Moselle.&nbsp; The singers were four Cornish miners, who were at
that time, 1854, employed at some lead mines near the town of
Zell.&nbsp; The leader or &lsquo;Captain,&rsquo; John Stocker,
said that the song was an established favourite with the lead
miners of Cornwall and Devonshire, and was always sung on the
pay-days, and at the wakes; and that his grandfather, who died
thirty years before, at the age of a hundred years, used to sing
the song, and say that it was very old.&nbsp; Stocker promised to
make a copy of it, but there was no opportunity of procuring it
before we left Germany.&nbsp; The following version has been
supplied by a gentleman in Plymouth, who writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I have had a great deal of trouble about <i>The
Valley Below</i>.&nbsp; It is not in print.&nbsp; I first met
with one person who knew one part, then with another person who
knew another part, but nobody could sing the whole.&nbsp; At
last, chance directed me to an old man at work on the roads, and
he sung and recited it throughout, not exactly, however, as I
send it, for I was obliged to supply a little here and there, but
only where a bad rhyme, or rather none at all, made it evident
what the real rhyme was.&nbsp; I have read it over to a mining
gentleman at Truro, and he says &lsquo;It is pretty near the way
we sing it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The tune is plaintive and original.]</p>

<h3>THE OLD MAN AND HIS THREE SONS.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">This</span> traditional ditty, founded
upon the old ballad inserted <i>ante</i>, p. 124, is current as a
nursery song in the North of England.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> was an old
man, and sons he had three, <a name="citation250"></a><a

&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well, Lion, good hunter.<br />
A friar he being one of the three,<br />
With pleasure he rang&egrave;d the north country,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he was a jovial hunter.</p>
<p class="poetry">As he went to the woods some pastime to see,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well, Lion, good hunter,<br />
He spied a fair lady under a tree,<br />
Sighing and moaning mournfully.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a jovial hunter.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;What are you doing, my fair
lady!&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind well, Lion, good hunter.<br />
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m frightened, the wild boar he will kill me,<br />
He has worried my lord, and wounded thirty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As thou art a jovial hunter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then the friar he put his horn to his mouth,<br

<p>[<span class="smcap">The</span> authorship of this song is
attributed to Richard Brome&mdash;(he who once &lsquo;performed a
servant&rsquo;s faithful part&rsquo; for Ben Jonson)&mdash;in a
black-letter copy in the Bagford Collection, where it is entitled
<i>The Beggars&rsquo; Chorus in the</i> &lsquo;<i>Jovial
Crew</i>,&rsquo; <i>to an excellent new tune</i>.&nbsp; No such
chorus, however, appears in the play, which was produced at the
Cock-pit in 1641; and the probability is, as Mr. Chappell
conjectures, that it was only interpolated in the
performance.&nbsp; It is sometimes called <i>The Jovial
Beggar</i>.&nbsp; The tune has been from time to time introduced
into several ballad operas; and the song, says Mr. Chappell, who
publishes the air in his <i>Popular Music</i>, &lsquo;is the
prototype of many others, such as <i>A bowling we will go</i>,
<i>A fishing we will go</i>, <i>A hawking we will go</i>, and
<i>A fishing we will go</i>.&nbsp; The last named is still
popular with those who take delight in hunting, and the air is
now scarcely known by any other title.]</p>

a different manner.&nbsp; When the young lady finds that she is
to be drowned, she very leisurely makes a particular examination
of the place of her intended destruction, and raises an objection
to some nettles which are growing on the banks of the stream;
these she requires to be removed, in the following poetical
stanza:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Go fetch the sickle, to crop the
nettle,<br />

For fear it should tangle my golden locks,<br />

<p><a name="footnote72b"></a><a href="#citation72b"
class="footnote">[72b]</a>&nbsp; This poor minstrel was born at
the village of Rylstone, in Craven, the scene of
Wordsworth&rsquo;s <i>White Doe of Rylstone</i>.&nbsp; King was
always called &lsquo;the Skipton Minstrel;&rsquo; and he merited
that name, for he was not a mere player of jigs and country
dances, but a singer of heroic ballads, carrying his hearers back
to the days of chivalry and royal adventure, when the King of
England called up Cheshire and Lancashire to fight the King of
France, and monarchs sought the greenwood tree, and hob-a-nobbed
with tinkers, knighting these Johns of the Dale as a matter of
poetical justice and high sovereign prerogative.&nbsp; Francis
King was a character.&nbsp; His physiognomy was striking and
peculiar; and, although there was nothing of the rogue in its
expression, for an honester fellow never breathed, he might have
sat for Wordsworth&rsquo;s &lsquo;Peter Bell.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
combined in a rare degree the qualities of the mime and the
minstrel, and his old jokes, and older ballads and songs, always
ensured him a hearty welcome.&nbsp; He was lame, in consequence
of one leg being shorter than the other, and his limping gait
used to give occasion to the remark that &lsquo;few Kings had had
more ups and downs in the world.&rsquo;&nbsp; He met his death by
drowning on the night of December 13, 1844.&nbsp; He had been at
a &lsquo;merry-making&rsquo; at Gargrave, in Craven, and it is
supposed that, owing to the darkness of the night, he mistook the
road, and walked into the river.&nbsp; As a musician his talents
were creditable; and his name will long survive in the village
records.&nbsp; The minstrel&rsquo;s grave is in the quiet
churchyard of Gargrave.&nbsp; Further particulars of Francis King
may be seen in Dixon&rsquo;s <i>Stories of the Craven Dales</i>,
published by Tasker and Son, of Skipton.</p>

two Irish versions, supplied by the late Mr. T. Crofton
Croker.&nbsp; One of them is entitled <i>Last New-Year&rsquo;s

follows the English song almost verbatim, with the exception of
the first and second verses, which we subjoin:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Last New-Year&rsquo;s day, as I heard

My spladdery clogs, <i>to save my brogues</i>!<br />
And in my pocket a lump of bread,<br />
And round my hat a ribbon red.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The other version is entitled <i>Dicky of Ballyman</i>, and a
note informs us that &lsquo;Dicky of Ballyman&rsquo;s sirname was
Byrne!&rsquo;&nbsp; As our readers may like to hear how the
Somersetshire bumpkin behaved after he had located himself in the
town of Ballyman, and taken the sirname of Byrne, we give the
whole of his amatory adventures in the sister-island.&nbsp; We
discover from them, <i>inter alia</i>, that he had found
&lsquo;the best of friends&rsquo; in his
&lsquo;Uncle,&rsquo;&mdash;that he had made a grand discovery in
natural history, viz., that a rabbit is a <i>fowl</i>!&mdash;that
he had taken the temperance pledge, which, however, his Mistress
Ann had certainly not done; and, moreover, that he had become an
enthusiast in potatoes!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">DICKY OF BALLYMAN.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;On New-Year&rsquo;s day, as I heard

<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh, Dicky! you go beneath your
mark,&mdash;<br />
You only wander in the dark;<br />
Sixpence a day will never do,<br />
I must have silks, and satins, too!</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&lsquo;Besides, Dicky, I must have
tea<br />
For my breakfast, every day;<br />
And after dinner a bottle of wine,&mdash;<br />
For without it I cannot dine.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&lsquo;If on fine clothes our money is
spent,<br />
Pray how shall my lord be paid his rent?<br />
He&rsquo;ll expect it when &rsquo;tis due,&mdash;<br />
Believe me, what I say is true.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&lsquo;As for tea, good stirabout<br />
Will do far better, I make no doubt;<br />
And spring water, when you dine,<br />
Is far wholesomer than wine.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&lsquo;Potatoes, too, are very nice
food,&mdash;<br />
I don&rsquo;t know any half so good:<br />
You may have them boiled or roast,<br />
Whichever way you like them most.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;This gave the company much delight,<br

And made them all to laugh outright;<br />
So Dicky had no more to say,<br />

is evidently that individual, and not the heathen deity, who is

Nelson&rsquo;s name was introduced out of respect to the late
Jack Rider, of Linton (who is himself introduced into the
following verse), an old tar who, for many years, was one of the
&lsquo;maskers&rsquo; in the district from whence our version was
obtained.&nbsp; Jack was &lsquo;loblolly boy&rsquo; on board the
&lsquo;Victory,&rsquo; and one of the group that surrounded the
dying Hero of Trafalgar.&nbsp; Amongst his many miscellaneous
duties, Jack had to help the doctor; and while so employed, he
once set fire to the ship as he was engaged investigating, by
candlelight, the contents of a bottle of ether.&nbsp; The fire
was soon extinguished, but not without considerable noise and
confusion.&nbsp; Lord Nelson, when the accident happened, was
busy writing his despatches.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s all that
noise about?&rsquo; he demanded.&nbsp; The answer was,
&lsquo;Loblolly boy&rsquo;s set fire to an empty bottle, and it
has set fire to the doctor&rsquo;s shop!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,
that&rsquo;s all, is it?&rsquo; said Nelson, &lsquo;then I wish
you and loblolly would put the fire out without making such a
confusion&rsquo;&mdash;and he went on writing with the greatest
coolness, although the accident might have been attended by the
most disastrous consequences, as an immense quantity of powder
was on board, and some of it close to the scene of the
disaster.&nbsp; The third day after the above incident Nelson was
no more, and the poor &lsquo;loblolly boy&rsquo; left the service
minus two fingers.&nbsp; &lsquo;Old Jack&rsquo; used often to
relate his &lsquo;accident;&rsquo; and Captain Carslake, now of
Sidmouth, who, at the time was one of the officers, permits us to
add his corroboration of its truth.</p>

<p><a name="footnote221b"></a><a href="#citation221b"
class="footnote">[221b]</a>&nbsp; The following account of Billy
Bolton may, with propriety, be inserted here:&mdash;It was a
lovely September day, and the scene was Arncliffe, a retired
village in Littondale, one of the most secluded of the Yorkshire
dales.&nbsp; While sitting at the open window of the humble
hostelrie, we heard what we, at first, thought was a
<i>ranter</i> parson, but, on inquiry, were told it was old Billy
Bolton reading to a crowd of villagers.&nbsp; Curious to
ascertain what the minstrel was reading, we joined the crowd, and
found the text-book was a volume of Hume&rsquo;s <i>England</i>,
which contained the reign of Elizabeth.&nbsp; Billy read in a
clear voice, with proper emphasis, and correct pronunciation,
interlarding his reading with numerous comments, the nature of
some of which may be readily inferred from the fact that the
minstrel belonged to what he called &lsquo;the ancient
church.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was a scene for a painter; the village
situate in one of the deepest parts of the dale, the twilight
hour, the attentive listeners, and the old man, leaning on his
knife-grinding machine, and conveying popular information to a
simple peasantry.&nbsp; Bolton is in the constant habit of so
doing, and is really an extraordinary man, uniting, as he does,
the opposite occupations of minstrel, conjuror, knife-grinder,
and schoolmaster.&nbsp; Such a labourer (though an humble one) in
the great cause of human improvement is well deserving of this
brief notice, which it would be unjust to conclude without
stating that whenever the itinerant teacher takes occasion to
speak of his own creed, and contrast it with others, he does so
in a spirit of charity; and he never performs any of his
sleight-of-hand tricks without a few introductory remarks on the
evil of superstition, and the folly of supposing that in the
present age any mortal is endowed with supernatural
attainments.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
